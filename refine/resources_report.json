After becoming interested in the American West, he led a wagon train into Colorado in 1866 and was Denver's first Jewish physician. He was appointed Denver County physician in 1870 and was the prime mover in the establishment of Denver's first general hospital (now Denver Health). In addition to a busy private practice, he also traveled the region as a mohel to perform the traditional Jewish rite of circumcision. Highly active in the Jewish and general community, served as the president of Denver's B'nai B'rith chapter in 1874.  Elsner was an incorporator of National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives in 1890 and served on the hospital's first medical advisory board.</p><p>The collection includes copies of his early memoirs, medical and early circumcision records, and other related documents.</p>"],"type":"abstract","persistent_id":"c8e671e11f73d52bd76da5fd79facfa7","publish":true}],"uri":"/repositories/2/resources/61","repository":{"ref":"/repositories/2"},"tree":{"ref":"/repositories/2/resources/61/tree"}}

The couple homested near Longmont, Colorado and then farmed near Broomfield, Colorado where they lived for years without running water or indoor plumbing for their family of nine children. The children started school in a one room schoolhouse. The schoolhouse was several miles from the farm and the children either walked or rode horses to school. The family sold their farmland to the Savory Mushroom Company during the Great Depression for $18,000. One of the nine children, Rose Muhlstein, married Samuel Ornstein in 1906 in Denver, Colorado.

The leaders of the community, including Bernard Leon Rayor, equally provided the funds for the building. When Mt. Sinai Congregation was completed, B.L. Rayor donated the ark curtains, which were left unused because his name was embroidered on them. The curtains were recently rediscovered in storage. </p><p>B.L. Rayor moved to Cheyenne with his wife Bessie and young family in 1918. As a builder and real estate broker since 1924, he donated the grounds for the elementary school and for the Veterans Hospital. Rayor Avenue was named in his honor. </p><p>B.L. Rayor’s youngest daughter Dorothy and son-in-law Joseph Feldman were committed members of the synagogue. After Joseph Feldman’s death, Dorothy Feldman donated his large collection of Jewish books to the synagogue to start its library. Mrs. Feldman became the synagogue librarian. The synagogue is still active for the small Cheyenne Jewish community.</p><p>B.L. Rayor’s youngest son, Harold Rayor, a Cheyenne native, lives in the Denver area with his wife Connie, a Jewish Denver native for generations (her grandmother, whose family were sharecroppers on a horse farm, was born in Denver in 1896). Their oldest two daughters (Linda and Diane) were born in Cheyenne, and the youngest (Janet) in Denver, where they were raised.</p><p>Harry Rachofsky, an immigrant from Poland via Manchester, England, was invited to join in a relative’s clothing store in Central City, Colorado. (Harry went on to have a series of unsuccessful general stores in various locations in Colorado; he also purchased a non-productive silver mine in La Plata County in 1916.) Miriam Kobey lived in Central City initially, but moved to Denver for a more observant Jewish life; she became a prominent midwife in Denver. Harry Rachofsky married his niece, Miriam Kobey’s daughter Betsy. Harry and Betsy had six children; their youngest, Bernard Leon, was born in Denver in 1892. Shortly after, the family moved to Durango, where Bernard Leon grew up.

In the 1940’s (probably after military service) he attended the University of North Carolina earning a B.A. degree in Theatre.  A student of Margaret Craske, Anthony Tudor and Boris Romanoff, Larry Boyette subsequently danced with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet for nine years (ca.1947-1956).  While at the Met, he performed on live television with the ballerina, Mia Slavenska for the Gala Opening of the 1954-1955 Met Opera Season in a ballet excerpted from the opera ''Aida.''  Boyette also appeared briefly on Broadway (ca.1956-1957) before joining (American) Ballet Theatre (1957-1959).  After performing with ABT, Boyette, along with fellow ABT alumnus George Tomal, moved to Denver, Colorado in 1959.  Both Boyette and Tomal became joint-directors of the Ballet Theatre School of Denver.  The school had been established in Denver in the early 1950's as a satellite school for the Ballet Theatre company and was later renamed Ballet Arts Center.</p><p>From 1959 until ca.1967 (when Georga Tomal left Denver and the co-directorship of the school) both Boyette and Tomal worked not only as instructors at the school, but also as choreographers for, among others, the Bonfils Theatre, Denver Lyric Opera and at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  It was also during this time that the ''Ballet Arts Performing Fund'' and the ''Ballet Arts Company'' were established.  Two additional satellite studios were founded in South-Denver and Boulder, Colorado in the mid-1960’s.  Starting in 1963, Tomal and Boyette had also alternated as an instructors of dance at the University of Colorado. After Tomal's departure, Boyette continued at the university until his retirement from CU in 1991.  </p><p>In 1973, Larry Boyette established the non-profit organization, ''Ballet Arts Foundation,'' devoted to the development of ballet in Colorado and the Rocky Mountain area. The purpose of the Ballet Arts Foundation was to develop taste and encourage appreciation for qualified, artistically sound, professional ballet performance.  The Foundation was also concerned with providing opportunities for young people to study with teachers of extraordinary merit, especially in the Cecchetti technique, sponsoring master classes and developing dance demonstrations to sensitize students in the public schools to the values of ballet. Finally, the Foundation believed in providing opportunities for young students to perform works in the different modes of ballet with dancers/choreographers of national and international reputation, and encouraged students to create original choreography, to be realized in performance.  The foundation's name was eventually changed to ''Foundation for Public Education in Ballet Arts,'' and finally to ''Ballet Arts Theatre'' in 1983. Between 1978 and 1984, Ballet Arts Theatre performed in at least twenty-five productions with the Denver Symphony Orchestra at Boettcher Concert Hall, including Kids Concerts. </p><p>Although Boyette sold his Ballet Arts studios in 1984, he continued to teach ballet through the beginning of year 2004.  Larry Boyette died in Denver, Colorado on March 16, 2004 of congestive heart failure at the age of 80.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"80c54795ce59f45a4bb4275db307d039","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The collection consists primarily of personal and professionally related photographs of Boyette's time as a dancer with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet (ca.1945-ca.1955) and (American) Ballet Theater (1956-1959).

He also served as advertising director and managing editor of the Gouverneur Tribune Press (NY). From that position, he continued working as advertising director for three upstate New York daily papers. After his service with the Army Tank Corps in World War II, Mitchell’s interest in communications turned to the electronic field. Mitchell joined the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) as manager of the Washington, D.C. Station, WTOP. In 1948, he assumed an executive position with the National Association of Broadcasters and in 1950 joined the Muzak Corporation as vice-president. His success in that post led to his selection as President of Encyclopedia Britannica Films, Inc., in 1962. Through his job at the National Association of Broadcasters, Mitchell taught several summer seminars (1948-1950) in broadcasting and communications management at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. He resigned in 1967 to become Chancellor of the University of Denver.</p><p>Maurice Mitchell was inaugurated Chancellor of the University of Denver on October 20, 1967. He served as the thirteenth Chancellor of the University of Denver from 1967 to 1978. He brought experience in business, education, and national affairs to the post. He served as Chancellor for eleven years, leaving in 1978 to become President of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, located in California. During his tenure at the University of Denver a host of new programs began, such as the annual Publishing Institute. Gifts also made several new buildings possible. The buildings constructed under his leadership include Penrose Library and the Shwayder Art Building. A noteworthy incident that occurred during his tenure was Woodstock West, a student protest against the Vietnam War. Due to his firm resolve, peace returned to campus and classes continued during the height of student protests across the United States.</p><p>He then left to work as President of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. Mitchell resigned from the Center when it merged with the University of California. In 1983, he became President of the Washington program at the Annenberg School of Communications. Mitchell served on the boards of many professional corporations and civic organizations including Colorado and Southern Railroad, the Federal Reserve Bank (Denver Branch), the Colorado State Historical Society, the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and the Colorado Springs Saving Bonds Committee. He received numerous awards for his hard work and dedication, including the Brotherhood Award, National Conference of Christians and Jews (1968); the George Washington Medal, Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge (1969); the Service to Mankind Award, Mile High Sertoma Club (1970); the Golden Plate Award, American Academy of Achievement (1972); and the Malcolm Glenn Wyer Award of the Adult Education Council of Metropolitan Denver (1975). He married Mary V. Rowles in 1951. They had three children, Lee, Keith, and Deborah. Mrs. Mitchell was active in the University of Denver Women’s Association, the Kent School for Girls, and several other organizations. She passed away in 1991. Maurice Mitchell died in 1996.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"4f24da2b50c5e21a108e293f4b8f4345","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Maurice B.

A like-minded group of female professors was called the Faculty Ladies Club of the downtown School of the University of Denver.  September 19, 1935 the two groups merged to form the Women’s Faculty Club.</p><p>After the merger, the Women’s Faculty Club expanded its membership to wives of ROTC and Aviation Training personnel.  Subgroups were organized for special interests, including Book Review, Contract Bridge, and Square Dancing, among others.  A Student Loan Fund was established, with funds raised at a Bridge Benefit at the Daniels and Fisher Tearoom.  During the War years, the group’s efforts were directed to such activities as Red Cross work, War Bonds, and U.S.O. events.</p><p>After the war there was a period of growth, both in the University population in general, fueled by the GI Bill, and in the faculty.  The Women’s Faculty Club expanded to include the wives of students, then secretaries and administrative assistants were invited to join.  New activities were initiated, including the Craft Guild, Fall Picnic, and Christmas Party.  During the 1950s the membership continued to expand as membership was extended to University Trustees’ wives, and the wives of Iliff Faculty.  The Women’s Faculty Club began supporting other campus activities, such as the Center for Students from Abroad, Student Health Services.  An annual D.U. Night at Central City Opera was added to the sponsored events.</p><p>The year 1964 was the centennial year for the University of Denver, and the decade of the 1960s saw an emphasis on historical aspects of the organization.  The War Bonds in which the organization had invested matured and were placed in a Centennial Fund which was used for such things as the improvement of the Phipps Conference Center and Buchtel House.  Buchtel House became the permanent meeting place for the organization in 1963. </p><p>In 1981 the Constitution and By-Laws of the Women’s Faculty Club were revised and the name was changed to The University of Denver Women’s Club.  The change recognized the fact that the organization had grown far beyond the original faculty wives.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"d214b1e1ea0c639e19f18e94e843d4b9","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The DU Women's Club Records encompas the history of the organization from its beginnings as the Women's Faculty Club.

Soon the need for another institution was felt by the Jewish community on Denver's west side. In 1904 the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society was organized by a group of twenty immigrant tradesmen, primarily to aid Jewish tubercular patients in all stages of the disease. They were assisted by Dr. Charles Spivak, Dr. Philip Hillkowitz, Dr. Adolph Zederbaum, Louis Robinson, Abraham Judlovitz, and noted Yiddish poet Solomon Bloomgarden (Yehoash), as well as many others from Denver's Eastern European Jewish community. Housed originally in wooden ''tent'' cottages, the patients were given the benefits of fresh air and wholesome kosher food. Spivak, an ardent socialist, emphasized that the hospital was to be a ''people's institution'' and was proud of the fact that the institution often collected its funds in dollars and quarters. Both the National Jewish Hospital and the JCRS would receive financial support as well as patients from Jewish communities throughout the United States.

Because of the onslaught of consumptives, beds for patients in city and state general hospitals were so scarce that the poor were frequently left to their own devices, often dying in the streets. One of the first people to conceive of a free hospital for the indigent tuberculosis victims in Denver was Frances Wisebart Jacobs. She launched a relentless campaign to arouse public awareness on behalf of the indigent consumptives, seeking the support of businessmen and political leaders to raise funds for a new hospital. Jacobs found an ally in a young, energetic rabbi who had just come to Denver: William Sterne Friedman. Rabbi Friedman enlisted the financial support of some of the trustees of his congregation, Temple Emanuel, insisting that concern for the sick and indigent had always been a vital tenet of Jewish tradition.</p><p>National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives (NJH) opened its doors  to Jews and gentiles alike in 1899 as the first sanatorium in Denver for tuberculosis victims. The hospital received financial assistance from the International Order of B'nai B'rith.  This vital support came largely through the efforts of Louis Anfenger, a local Jewish citizen who was also a founder of both Temple Emanuel and the Denver B'nai B'rith. The hospital opened with one building: the Frances Jacobs Hospital Building. Samuel Grabfelder of Louisville, Kentucky, was named president, and Alfred Mueller was named secretary.</p><p>As a result of national support, NJH introduced a revolutionary concept to tuberculosis treatment by offering free services to indigent consumptives. The meeting minutes of September 24, 1899, state that ''no pay shall be accepted from any patient and that the hospital should be absolutely free to those suffering from consumption, who are unable for want of means to procure proper attention.'' Only patients with incipient tuberculosis, where treatment could be most efficacious, were to be admitted to NJH, and the length of stay was limited to six months. These conditions reflect the medical opinion of the time and the scarcity of hospital beds for consumptives. It was commonly thought that attempting to treat advanced cases only wasted time and money that could be more profitably directed toward patients who had a good chance of recovery. </p><p>National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives changed its name several times, subsequently being known as National Jewish Hospital and later becoming National Jewish Hospital and Research Center, National Jewish Hospital/National Asthma Center (after merging with National Asthma Center in 1978), National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, and National Jewish Medical and Research Center. Now known as National Jewish Health, the facility continues to treat patients from throughout the country using cutting-edge medicine and research.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"3879c4c840a3a1bbbdcadbd5bba2270c","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The collection includes annual reports, correspondence, limited patient records, meeting minutes, financial statements, reports, scrapbooks, photographs, sound discs, and objects from 1899 to 2007.

NAC was an independent institution from 1907 until 1978, when it merged with National Jewish Hospital. The NAC campus in west Denver at 19th and Julian Streets was sold in 1981. During the last part of the nineteenth century, Denver, Colorado became a haven for those suffering from tuberculosis, ''the white plague.'' However, no formal medical treatment facilities existed until the opening of National Jewish Hospital (NJH) in 1899. Five years later the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS) began treating patients with advanced cases of tuberculosis.  A Denver housewife, Fannie Lorber, became concerned about the plight of Jewish children left homeless by a parent's hospitalization or orphaned by a parent's death at NJH or JCRS. In 1907, she and her friends Bessie Willens and Sadie Francis organized other local East European immigrant women and founded the Denver Sheltering Home. For the next 51 years, Fannie Lorber presided over the volunteer board of the Home and was the driving force behind fundraising efforts. At first funded entirely by the Denver Jewish Community, the home's expansion eventually led to a system of fundraising Ladies' Auxiliaries throughout the United States. The Home originally sheltered only orphaned or neglected children of tuberculosis victims, but it soon expanded its mission to help combat delinquency among Denver's Jewish children. An arrangement was made with Judge Ben B. Lindsey to send first offenders to the home rather than to a detention center. (Judge Lindsey created the Colorado Juvenile Court system.) The Home also began taking in orphaned and needy children from other cities, and by 1920, approximately 100 children were living on the expanded campus. The aim of the home's founders was to provide a cultured, stimulating, and Jewish environment for the children that was as close to family life as possible, unlike most orphanages of the period. In 1939 the home instituted the long-term residential treatment of children with intractable asthma. In the 1950s medical, psychiatric, and research personnel were added to treat children with asthma and allergies. In 1951, Dr. Allan Hurst became the first full-time medical director and Jack Gershtenson became the administrator, a position he held for nearly thirty years. The home officially became non-sectarian in 1953. Dr. Murray Pershkin, chief consultant to the home from 1940 until 1959, advocated ''parentectomy,'' the removal of the child from his or her home for up to two years. In 1957, the Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital was created. At the time it was the only research facility in the county dedicated to asthma and allergic diseases. In 1966, Drs. Kimishige and Taruko Ishizaka, a husband and wife research team at CARIH, discovered immunoglobin E, the physiological basis for asthma. By the 1970s National Jewish Hospital had gone from treating tuberculosis to treating a broader range of respiratory diseases, including asthma. It was decided in 1978 that a merger of the two institutions would be beneficial. Patients remained at the NAC campus until 1981, when it was closed. Fannie Lorber was president from 1907 to 1958, Arthur Lorber was president from 1958 to 1975, and Charles M. Schayer was president from 1975 to 1978.</p>","publish":true}],"persistent_id":"8b4a9d6d96154c7ff6454baec2197a45","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The National Asthma Center Records include the By-laws of the organization, meeting minutes, correspondence, memorandums, charts, speeches, financial statements, newspaper clippings, publications, photographs, and miscellaneous material.

Anthony was determined that women should participate in the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893. Anthony assigned Hannah G. Solomon the task of organizing a group of Jewish women to participate in the Fair. Solomon invited 90 Jewish women to attend the events in Chicago. During discussions at the the Parliament of Religions of the Chicago World's Fair, Solomon convinced her Jewish colleagues of the need for a national organization, and so began the National Council of Jewish Women. Among the women attending the session was Carrie Benjamin, who returned home to Denver, Colorado and organized the Council's Denver section in October 1893. Thirty-nine women met at Temple Emanuel and elected Carrie Benjamin the first president.</p><p>Carrie Benjamin and the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) worked in the areas of religion, teaching, and philanthropy. Eventually the Council would take a stand on various social issues and reach out to help the community at large. Education was one of the Denver Section's first efforts. They taught classes on West Colfax Avenue to recent Eastern European immigrants, including cooking and sewing classes. Kindergartens (not yet a part of the public school system) were established. By 1908 the Council's adult evening classes offered a variety of subjects, including hammered brass, literature, dramatics, debating and Jewish studies.</p><p>In 1910 the Council supervised a summer playground at Cheltenham School on West Colfax Avenue and Julian Street. The Council also established a Citizen's Committee For Public Schools, which worked with other civic organizations to improve Denver's schools and to secure the necessary financial support by issuing bonds. The Council worked closely with Judge Ben Lindsey, founder of Denver's Juvenile Court, and founded a Settlement House in West Denver for Jewish boys. Council members worked regularly at Wallace School (a private school for children with brain injuries) and a group of Council women founded the Children's Traveling Theatre and performed in orphanages and hospitals.</p><p>Seraphine Pisko, who served as executive secretary at National Jewish Hospital, was elected to the National Board of the Council and in 1907 was president of the Denver Section. When she saw a sign at a hotel that proclaimed ''No Jews--no consumptives,'' the Council and the Denver B'nai B'rith Lodge successfully lobbied the Colorado Legislature for a bill to prohibit such language in signs and advertisements.</p><p>The Council participated in the resettlement of refugees during the Holocaust in Germany. The Council furnished apartments for the refugees, taught them English, and instructed them how to navigate in America. The Council's Committee for Service to the Foreign Born helped members of the Denver community bring European relatives to America. All the efforts were the beginning of a resettlement program that came to prominence when the Denver Jewish Family and Children's Service was established in 1945. The Council worked closely with this agency to develop a resettlement plan known as the ''Denver Plan,'' which became a model for similar programs in other cities.

The leaders of the Colorado Committee of Concern for Soviet Jewry, Rabbi Raymond Zwerin and Lillian Hoffman, asked Denver Mayor McNichols if he would name a street Babi Yar. McNichols suggested that an undeveloped Denver-owned 27-acre site could be developed and named Babi Yar Park. Helen Ginsburg, a Denver sculptor, agreed to chair a committee for the purpose of developing the park site. In April of 1971, a committee was organized to raise funds to develop the park and create a sculpture. The committee hired Lawrence Halprin Associates, an internationally known landscape architecture firm who had designed Denver’s Skyline Park, to design the park. The Babi Yar Park Foundation was formed under the leadership of Helen Ginsburg. In 1985, leading Holocaust scholar Eli Wiesel attended a service at the park and in a second event, a survivor of the massacre visited the park and noted how similar the park was to the Babi Yar ravine.  In 2005, Larry Mizel agreed to allow the Mizel Museum to take over stewardship and the Foundation was dissolved and merged into the Mizel Museum’s program. Alan Golin Gass, a Denver architect, and other Foundation members continued to be active in the Babi Yar planning process. The artist-architect team of Kryzsztof Wodiczko and Julian Bonder was hired to create a Memorial to Victims of World Terrorism at Babi Yar Park.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"9fca0c60c85466419c0c13d504b5df4f","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The records are arranged in two series: 1.

The JFCS emerged from two organizations, the National Council of Jewish Women, Denver Section (NCJW), founded in 1893 and the Central Jewish Aid Society of Denver, Colorado, organized in 1915 and incorporated in 1923. Ray David was the first superintendent of the Jewish Aid Society. In 1937, Tillye Levy became a member of the Service to Foreign Born Committee of the NCJW and immediately began organizing resources for Jews who fled the early stages of the Holocaust. The services supplied facilitated the adjustment of the refugees. At Tillye Levy’s request, Isadore Hilb became the first chair of the new Denver Coordinating Committee for Refugees. A. B. Hirshfield was the chair of the job placement committee, Dave Harlem was in charge of creating affidavits, and Surriee Feder Miller was responsible for integrating newcomers into the Denver community. In 1947, the Jewish Family and Children’s Service was created when the boards of the Central Jewish Aid Society and the NCJW committees merged. Sydney Grossman became the newly formed agency’s first president, and Dr. Alfred Neumann, a social worker, became the full-time director. The name was changed to the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Denver in 1954 and became the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Colorado in 1972. The JFCS continued to give relief to the needy and assist refugees in resettling, but also expanded into the field of family and child welfare. The JFCS created the “Denver Plan,” procedures for integrating new residents into the community, which was copied by cities across the United States. The agency hired trained staff to provide service in three areas: family, child, and vocational guidance; service to established residents; and immigrant aid. The agency also handled German reparation money through the Utility Workshop, headed by Mary (Mrs. Sidney) Jacobs. The Utility Workshop produced jobs and services for individuals suffering from emotional or physical handicaps.

The Shwayders later moved to Nevadaville (Black Hawk), Colorado, and in 1888 they settled in Denver, where Isaac Shwayder owned a grocery store and later started a second-hand furniture business.

The operation became incorporated as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company in 1912 and counted many members of the Shwayder family among its employees. All of the Shwayder brothers held executive positions in the company in the 1920s: Jesse was the company's president, Mark Shwayder was in charge of sales, Maurice and Ben Shwayder were in charge of manufacturing, and Solomon Shwayder served as the company’s lawyer. Samson was the first trade name for the company’s luggage, and this was later changed to Samsonite. Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company started to diversify its product offerings in the 1930s by manufacturing folding furniture, and the company changed its name to Shwayder Brothers, Inc. in 1931. As sales increased throughout the 20th century, the company moved into gradually larger facilities in Denver, and at various stages in the business’ history, it opened additional plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arizona, Mexico, and Japan.  In 1961 Jesse Shwayder’s son, King D. Shwayder, became president of the company, and in 1965 the Shwayder Brothers, Inc., changed its name to Samsonite Corporation. The corporation continues to operate in the 21st century.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"10e0c4e7832cc022ce717181209354d8","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The collection consists of materials containing Shwayder Family history dating back to the late 19th century as well as information about the founding and development of the Samsonite Corporation through the 1970s.

He and his wife Charlotte Gorden were leaders of the Orthodox Jewish community on Denver's west side and helped the Hebrew Educational Alliance. Velvel Heller, Jacob Gorden's uncle, had established himself as a schocket in Denver. Velvel Heller wrote his nephew of the opportunities in Denver and Jacob decided that he emigrate from Kolk, Russia to Denver in 1914. Jacob Gorden became a schocket and by 1917 had saved enough money to bring his wife Charlotte Gorden and his daughter Bess Gorden to Denver. In the next few years two more daughters and a son were born to the Gordens. The Gordens then moved to 1490 Julian Street. In 1935 Jacob Gorden also began work as a mohel. In 1944 Jacob Gorden was asked by Dr. Maurice Shapiro of Albuquerque, New Mexico to perform ritual circumcisions in New Mexico. In Albuquerque a blindfold was placed over Jacob Gorden's eyes for the ride to the final destination. Jacob Gorden only told his wife where he had been after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. He could then tell his wife that he had been in Las Animas, New Mexico. In 1926, Charlotte Gorden, Mrs. Chernyk and Mrs. S. Friedman began the Beth David Sisterhood for the purpose of building a school for Jewish children. The Beth David Brotherhood was formed to help with fundraising and the two groups founded the Beth Jacob Hebrew School at the Gorden home in 1929. The Denver Hebrew Institute was willing to merge with the new group and the organization became the Hebrew Education Alliance, a synagogue with a focus on Jewish Education. Jacob Gorden became the Gabbai (the person in charge of selecting the Torah readings during the Sabbath service) for the new sysnagogue and served in that position for over forty years.

Growing up in pre-World War II Germany, Henry attended a Jewish school and was a member of a Jewish boy scout group where he learned to survive the Nazi terror.</p><p>Max Loewenstein was born in Lessen, West Prussia on May 17, 1885.  He moved to Germany to study medicine and worked as a ships doctor before becoming an army doctor during World War I.  After the war he settled in Berlin where he specialized in dermatology and venereal disease.

Maria studied art in St. Petersburg, Russia where she married her first husband Erich Steinberg in 1914.  Their daughter, Karin, was born in 1915 in Helsinki, Finland.

In this capacity, she was part of a secret meeting in early 1946 between Grotewohl and Wilhem Pieck, leader of the German Communists.  Steinberg learned of their plans against the Western Powers and passed the information to an American contact.  In order to protect the Loewenstein family, the United States government facilitated the family's immigration to the United States in 1946.</p><p>In 1947, Heinrich Loewenstein [Henry Lowenstein] joined his family in the United States after emigrating from England.  It was after the family's immigration to the United States that they changed their name to Lowenstein.  Henry Lowenstein served in the Air Force, then attended Yale University Drama School in 1953.  After graduation he was recruited by Helen Bonfils to design and produce shows for the Bonfils Theatre in Denver, Colorado later called the Lowenstein Theatre. He also produced plays for the Denver Civic Theatre until his retirement in 1995.</p><p>The Loewenstein family, Henry Lowenstein's paternal ancestors, lived in Lessen, West Prussia.  Levin Loewenstein, his great-grandfather, was granted Prussian citizenship in 1848 and with citizenship was able to choose a last name.  Prior to Levin Loewenstein's citizenship, the family, like all Jews in Eastern Europe, was denied a last name.  Levin's son Emil was a grain merchant married to Ernestine.  Upon Emil's death in 1908, Ernestine continued to operate the business until the area was ceded to Poland in 1918.  Ernestine, called ''Omchen'' by her family, then moved to Berlin, Germany to be near her sons, Max and Georg Loewenstein.  Ernestine died a natural death in 1940 before her son and daughter-in-law, Georg and Alice Loewenstein, were deported to the Lodz Ghetto.</p><p>The Bätge family, Henry Lowenstein's maternal ancestors, lived in Tallinn, Estonia.  Ernst Carl Friedrich Bätge, his great-grandfather, was a merchant and served as mayor of Tallinn 1864-1875.  Ernst disinherited his son Dr. Arthur Ernst Bätge when Arthur decided to become a medical doctor rather than join the family's merchant business.  Arthur was married to Therese Sophie Agathe Berg the daughter of a merchant.  Their daughter was Marie Lilli Margarete Bätge Steinberg Loewenstein.</p><p>Henry Lowenstein's cousin, Ingrid Lind, was raised by the Loewensteins after her mother died and her Danish father deserted his children. In 1939, Ingrid went to Denmark as she had duel citizenship and a Danish passport. From there she went to Sweden, then across Russia to the Middle East where she joined the British Army. Ingrid was in England at the end of the war.</p>","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true},{"persistent_id":"dad9b116f217c521e8693e1743173287","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"content":"Materials in this collection were gathered and preserved by Henry Lowenstein's mother Maria Loewenstein.

The JFCS emerged from two organizations, the National Council of Jewish Women, Denver Section (NCJW), founded in 1893 and the Central Jewish Aid Society of Denver, Colorado, organized in 1915 and incorporated in 1923. Ray David was the first superintendent of the Jewish Aid Society. In 1937, Tillye Levy became a member of the Service to Foreign Born Committee of the NCJW and immediately began organizing resources for Jews who fled the early stages of the Holocaust. The services supplied facilitated the adjustment of the refugees. At Tillye Levy’s request, Isadore Hilb became the first chair of the new Denver Coordinating Committee for Refugees. A. B. Hirshfield was the chair of the job placement committee, Dave Harlem was in charge of creating affidavits, and Surriee Feder Miller was responsible for integrating newcomers into the Denver community. In 1947, the Jewish Family and Children’s Service was created when the boards of the Central Jewish Aid Society and the NCJW committees merged. Sydney Grossman became the newly formed agency’s first president, and Dr. Alfred Neumann, a social worker, became the full-time director. The name was changed to the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Denver in 1954 and became the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Colorado in 1972. The JFCS continued to give relief to the needy and assist refugees in resettling, but also expanded into the field of family and child welfare. The JFCS created the “Denver Plan,” procedures for integrating new residents into the community, which was copied by cities across the United States. The agency hired trained staff to provide service in three areas: family, child, and vocational guidance; service to established residents; and immigrant aid. The agency also handled German reparation money through the Utility Workshop, headed by Mary (Mrs. Sidney) Jacobs. The Utility Workshop produced jobs and services for individuals suffering from emotional or physical handicaps.

The JCRS was established in 1904 in Lakewood, Colorado for the treatment of tuberculosis, then the leading cause of death in the United States. The original JCRS campus is now the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design (RMCAD). As a Professor in the Communications Design Department at RMCAD, Mendelsberg was developing a new course for graphic designers that challenged students to consider the power of storytelling in words and pictures. Access to the Beck archives offered his students the chance to examine thousands of primary source photographs, documents, and artifacts first hand. </p><p>In 2005, the first group of design students enrolled in Mendelsberg’s “Visual Sequencing” course carried out research in the Beck Archives, where they began the process of researching patient files for the purpose of developing compelling stories and histories that would eventually come to fruition in the form of photographic studies, typographic studies and illustrated books. This course project was continued on a yearly base through 2013 and resulted in dozens of beautiful, engaging students artists’ books based on the lives of a number of early JCRS TB patients. The experience of sorting through original documents was transforming, and as one student noted, “It’s exciting to hold these documents in your hands and carefully sort through the dust of history.” Highlighted in this display are six examples of the books the students produced, as well as the JCRS archival materials that inspired their work.</p>","jsonmodel_type":"note_text"}],"type":"bioghist","jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","publish":true}],"uri":"/repositories/2/resources/570","repository":{"ref":"/repositories/2"},"tree":{"ref":"/repositories/2/resources/570/tree"}}

Did some ancient Greek traveler bargain for a model pyramid to remember a voyage up the Nile? Did a painted vase from Athens have sentimental value for a young man of classical Rome, completing his studies? We can only guess. Neither theater history nor sociological research reveal when the souvenir program came to be.</p><p>But a prime example for both theater and dance must be the 'Balet Comiqve de la Royne,' a 1582 publication ''avec privilege'' from the ''Impremeurs du Roy'' (Adrian le Roy, Robert Ballard, Mamert Patisson). Was this commemoration of a court spectacle, or a desire to exert political propaganda? For sure, this publication, which describes in detail the production (a paean for a new ''golden age'' as exemplified in the marriage of the queen's sister to a royal noble) might just as well have provided a remembrance - a souvenir to any of the courtiers who participated or witnessed the event.</p><p>During successive centuries ''airs de ballet'' (booklets of featured tunes) were printed in France. Surely these count as commercial souvenirs (and yes, commercial enterprise and souvenirs have been linked since inception).</p><p>But it wasn't until the 18th century and the cult of the performer that theatrical souvenirs became popular. Look at all those lithographs of early ballerinas, gracing sheet music for the newly respectable parlor piano. Surely the next permutation must have been, by then, obvious - a booklet, offered to theater patrons and taking much of the effort out of souvenir mongering.</p><p>As a definition, then, a souvenir program could be described as:</p><p>(1) a commercial enterprise (often produced as part of a marketing plan)</p><p>(2) designed to emphasize a company or show and the personalities connected whether on stage or as creative forces (e.g. author, composer, choreographer or lyricist) with</p><p>(3) photographs, short biographies and related information.</p><p>In contrast, a house program is one that is distributed at a performance to members of the audience attending the event.  The house program usually deals with only the specifics of the actual performance itself: title, composer, designer, cast list, and company roster.  </p><p>At its best a souvenir program can contain accurate and otherwise unavailable company histories, biographical notes and repertory lists. Noted critics were solicited for essays evaluating the company in question. More rarely artists themselves contributed. Anton Dolin, Eugene Loring and Antony Tudor all wrote for the early Ballet Theatre's souvenir books. The exact facts of a dance production (music, libretto, costumes, lighting) can often be found in the lowly souvenir program.</p><p>Additionally a souvenir program may contain fine art photography by noted artists, such as George Platt Lynes for the New York City Ballet, or hard-to- find information such as a discography of Philippine music from the Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company. While souvenir programs are predominantly attached to staged shows, they may be issued, too, for exhibitions and gala film openings. (Some programs have virtually no value beyond naming company members.)</p><p>The Carson-Brierly Dance Library's holdings comprise an initial 640 items spanning nearly the whole of the 20th century. The earliest, ca. 1906, is devoted to Adeline Genee; one of the most recent is for Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance. The first has a dance history expanded with quotations by Genee; the last merely notes the show was ''Created, choreographed and produced by Michael Flatley,'' with many color photographs of Flatley and the barest mention of other company members.</p><p>As a further aid to remembrance, some souvenir programs have newspaper reviews or house programs laid in, or autographs from the performers themselves.</p><p>The souvenir and house programs are arranged in alphabetical order by company name or performer's surname. Some performers and some companies have been through several name changes as noted. The programs are under the name as it appears on the program (thus, 'Ballet Theatre' and 'American Ballet Theatre') with one notable exception: Pavlova is under the surname rather than the confusing permutations and partnerships she created.</p>","publish":true}],"persistent_id":"2de2f186bbb2b503be8a5177054e4332","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Carson-Brierly Dance Library's Souvenir Program Collection comprises souvenir and house programs related to dance: productions, companies, and festivals; as well as the dance aspects of Broadway musicals, operas, ice skating productions, and films.

Renamed the Colorado Dance Festival soon after, the enterprise gained a national reputation for presenting new, young performers and companies. During subsequent seasons the festival expanded to a full month of workshops, classes, and performances in a variety of venues. The Colorado Dance Festival was a pioneer in spearheading the American tap dance revival. A legendary 1986 presentation at the Casino Cabaret in Denver’s Five Points (the city’s traditional hub of African-American identity and culture) called “The Great Tap Reunion” presented dancers Eddie Brown, Charles “Honi” Coles, Steven Condos, Jimmy Slyde, and Gregory Hines. A later festival offered some of the younger greats of the genre including a young Savion Glover. The International Tap Association grew out of this impetus and continues to publish a magazine devoted to tap dance aficionados. A performance in 1988 of Robert Davidson’s “Meister Eckhart” introduced audiences to the potential of “aerial dance,” that is, the use of low-flying trapeze technique as a legitimate facet of dance.

His parents moved the family to California, where his father was briefly involved in real estate, then back to Denver and eventually to Colorado Springs, where Lloyd Shaw lived for the remainder of his life.  He attended The Colorado College for undergraduate studies.  Immediately after graduating in 1913, he married Dorothy Cory Stott (Dorothy Stott Shaw, November 26, 1891-March 12, 1985), and began a lengthy career as an educator.  In 1916 he was hired to teach at and be principal of Cheyenne Mountain School in the Broadmoor area, and became superintendent of the Cheyenne Mountain School District shortly afterward.  Dorothy was simultaneously hired to be the school librarian.  Lloyd and Dorothy remained at Cheyenne Mountain School until their mutual retirement in June of 1951.  While at Cheyenne Mountain, Shaw pursued a radical transformation of the school’s academic and athletic offerings until they included carpentry, astronomy, Native studies, rodeo, skiing, hiking, and folk dancing, in addition to more traditional subjects. In 1928 and 1937 he was awarded Honorary Doctorates from The Colorado College and the University of Colorado, respectively.   In 1936 Lloyd Shaw took a group of dancers to perform at Central City; the group became known as The Cheyenne Mountain Dancers, and farther-ranging tours commenced shortly afterward, with their first cross-national trip happening in 1939.  Also in 1939, Shaw published his best-known work, “Cowboy Dances,” and with his dancers conducted a demonstration in Chicago for the annual conference of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation; together, these generated enough demand that in 1940 he began running summer institutes for educators interested in western square dancing. The classes went on hiatus from 1942-1944 for World War II, but began again in 1945 and continued until after his retirement in 1951.  By the end of the run there were three sessions each summer, including a special invitation-only fellowship in August which continued even after his death; its membership eventually became the nucleus of the Lloyd Shaw Foundation. In 1950 Lloyd Shaw founded a record company, Lloyd Shaw Records, in collaboration with Fred Bergin, owner of Rinx Records.   He passed away on July 18, 1958 and was buried in the Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs.  His wife, Dorothy; a daughter, Doli Shaw (Doli Obee); and Doli’s children, Enid Allison Obee (Enid Cocke) and Kent  David Obee, survived him.</p><p>Lloyd Shaw attended local elementary schools in Glendale, California and Denver, Colorado, as well as Colorado Springs, CO; after the family moved to Colorado Springs, he graduated from Colorado Springs High School in 1909.  Following graduation, he attended The Colorado College for four years, graduating in 1913 with a Bachelors of Arts (AB).  During his sophomore year he became engaged to Dorothy Cory Stott, who also graduated in 1913.  Following graduation, Lloyd Shaw was hired to teach science and English courses at Cutler Academy, the preparatory school run by The Colorado College.  When Cutler Academy shut down in 1914, he was hired by the Colorado Springs High School as a biology teacher, simultaneously coaching dramatics both there and at the college.  He remained at Colorado Springs High School from 1914 until 1916, when he quit and became principal of the Cheyenne Mountain School.  In addition, his work there included teaching Senior English as well as coaching sports and dramatics.  In 1917 he wrote The Littlest Wiseman, a Christmas pageant that would be performed by the school annually until his retirement; it was officially published as a book in 1951 and is still being performed.  In 1919 school officials asked Shaw to return to Colorado Springs High School as principal, but he declined; by 1920 he had been promoted to Superintendent of Cheyenne Mountain School District.  In 1928 The Colorado College awarded him an honorary Doctorate, followed by the University of Colorado giving him an honorary Doctorate of Education in 1937.  He retired from the District in 1951 due to health problems, but remained an influential figure in the local community and in the national square dance scene.  In addition to his work as an educator and dance leader, Lloyd Shaw wrote regular newspaper articles.  The first of these were published in 1915 and collected into his book, “Nature Notes of the Pikes Peak Region,” which was published in 1916.  Near the end of his life, from 1956 until 1957, the Colorado Springs Free Press published his daily column, ”Half a Century of Memories.”</p><p>Significant organizational memberships and relationships in Shaw’s life included his extended relationship with The Colorado College, where he served as class president, yearbook editor, dramatics coach, and as an Alumni Trustee from 1923-1936 and 1938-1942; he also conducted at least one series of dance courses on the college campus.  He helped set up the first branch of the Colorado Mountain Club outside the city of Denver in 1919, was president of the Winter Night Club in 1937, and was a member of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation.  With regard to dance, he was associated with some of the early National Square Dance Conventions, serving as Master of Ceremonies at the 3rd National Convention in 1954, and was on the organizing committee for the National Folk Festival in 1940.  He was the primary teacher, choreographer, and caller for the Cheyenne Mountain Dancers from the 1920s until his retirement, and choreographed the dancing for the 1946 movie “Duel in the Sun.” He initially recorded his own calling with Decca Records and the “Duel in the Sun Orchestra,” but in 1950 started his own label, Lloyd Shaw Records, in conjunction with Fred Bergin; it focused on round dance and folk dance music, but also included square dance tunes.  He worked with Alfred Brown of the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind to help them create their own square dance exhibition team, and was indirectly associated with the American Square Dance Association, contributing several letters and articles to the periodical “Sets in Order.”  Both of his major dance books, “Cowboy Dances” in 1939 and “The Round Dance Book” in 1947, were published by the Caxton Printers, in Idaho; after his death, this formed the basis for a continued relationship with the Lloyd Shaw Foundation.</p><p>Dr. Shaw was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, both during his life and posthumously.  Significant among these are his two honorary doctorates, a 1949 citation from the American Academy of Physical Education for his folk dancing program, the Sets in Order Foundation’s first Silver Spur Award in 1956, induction into the Sets in Order Square Dance Hall of Fame in 1961 as its first member, and a posthumous Milestone Award from CALLERLAB in 1983.  More recently, in October of 2012 he was named to the Cheyenne Mountain School District 12 Hall of Fame.</p><p>Lloyd Shaw had relationships with many, if not most, of the important leaders involved in square and folk dancing during his lifetime.  His initial contact was Elizabeth Burchenal; he also frequently corresponded with and visited Ralph Page in New Hampshire.  Herb Greggorson, whom he met in 1940 during a visit to El Paso, Texas, also became a frequent correspondent and participated in a round robin style letter along with Al Brundage, who attended Shaw’s summer class in 1949.  Other major contacts include Bob Brundage, who attended a class in 1954; and Bob Osgood, whom Shaw met in 1946 during a visit to California.  Dean Edwards, also a successful caller from Colorado Springs, had something of a philosophical rivalry with Lloyd Shaw.  </p><p>The Shaw family was also extensively involved with square dancing both during and after Lloyd’s death.  His older brother, Ray Shaw, was a caller in California for the Rip and Snort club where Bob Osgood danced.  Dorothy Shaw became a highly significant figure in the square dance world herself, lecturing widely, helping to start the Lloyd Shaw Foundation, and serving as Executive Secretary until 1979.  Lloyd and Dorothy’s daughter Doli married Donald Jenkins Obee, who served as President of the Foundation from 1965 until 1979; their daughter, Enid Cocke, has served as President since August of 1979.</p><p>The Lloyd Shaw Foundation was voted into existence in August of 1964, following the yearly Lloyd Shaw Summer Fellowship held at the home of Dorothy Stott Shaw in Colorado Springs, CO.  It was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Colorado Springs, and the original membership consisted of 46 dance leaders from across the United States and Canada; by 1966 there were over 140 members.  The Foundation is still incorporated in the state of Colorado, but its headquarters address moved to Manhattan, Kansas in 1979.  The stated purpose of the organization is to, “Recall, restore, and teach the folk rhythms of the American people.”  Implicit in the mission is the additional goal of doing so in a manner consistent with the educational and dance philosophies of Lloyd Shaw.  The first President of the Foundation was Don Armstrong, who served from 1964-1965; he stepped down under the conviction that a member of Lloyd Shaw’s family should serve as president.  Donald Jenkins Obee, Shaw’s son-in-law, served as president from 1965 until 1979, and was followed in this position by his daughter Enid Cocke, 1979 to present.  Dorothy Stott Shaw, Lloyd Shaw’s wife, served as Executive Secretary from 1964 until 1979.  Although the Foundation originally drew its membership from the Lloyd Shaw Summer Fellowship attendees, and conducted its annual meeting after the close of each Fellowship until 1978, the two were never officially affiliated.  The Lloyd Shaw Foundation has had significant relationships with a number of other organizations, including the United Square Dancers of America, Legacy, and CALLERLAB, The Country Dance and Song Society, the New England Square Dance Foundation, and international music distributors.  In 1986 the Library of Congress named the Archives Division as a clearing house for square dance materials, and in 1987 the Archives helped form the National Dance Archives Coordinating Committee. </p><p>The Lloyd Shaw Foundation’s primary functions and activities are educational; although it focuses on square and contra dancing, many other dance traditions are represented in its programs.  Under the Foundation’s auspices, college credit-granting workshops were conducted at Colorado State University from 1965 until the mid-1970s, and at other universities and colleges as well; workshops and teacher training courses continue to be held around the country and internationally, and the Foundation and its members have consistently conducted presentations and dances at the request of numerous organizations.  The Foundation has actively produced and revised targeted dance education kits to assist teachers in dance education since 1966, including resources designed specifically for grades from kindergarten through high school as well as special education students.  Other activities have included sponsoring and running dance camps, particularly the Rocky Mountain Dance Roundup in Colorado, Cumberland Gap in Kentucky, and Terpsichore’s Holiday in West Virginia; providing scholarships for members and groups to attend various dance camps around the country and to travel internationally; and providing research and historical services through the Lloyd Shaw Dance Library and the Archives Division.   The Foundation has also acted as a publisher for musical recordings and dance books, and publishes its own journal.  </p><p>Since 1967, members of the Board of Directors have served for a maximum of two consecutive three-year terms, with descendants and relatives of Lloyd Shaw being exempt from the term limits.  From 1976 until 2004, the Archives Division existed as an independent entity within the Lloyd Shaw Foundation administrative structure, overseen by its director and the Executive Directors.  The Foundation maintained an office for its mailing operations in Lakewood, CO from 1972 until they were moved to Albuquerque, NM in 1988, where they shared facilities with the Archives Division.  The Archives Division was disbanded after its materials were donated to the University of Denver in 2003.</p><p>In 1972 the Lloyd Shaw Foundation Dance Archives was started by Mary D Walsh.  At the time, it consisted of a single 8mm film of E.S. “Red“ Henderson calling for his Spokane, Washington-based performance group, the Silver Spurs.  In August of 1976 the Foundation’s Board of Directors voted to create an official Archives Division; Dr. Litchman was appointed Director, under the direction of the Executive Committee.  By December the Archives was offering photocopies, research services, and a tape recording service; the organizational newsletter, the “Long Shadow,” actively solicited donations of both money and materials.  In 1978 the Board of Directors voted to provide an operating budget and funds for acquisitions.  Prior to and even after the formation of the Archives researchers had access to the Lloyd Shaw Dance Library, which consisted of Lloyd Shaw’s personal collection, at the home of Dorothy Shaw in Colorado Springs, CO.  Some of these resources were later incorporated into the Archives, but many remained in the possession of the family.  The Archives was housed at Dr. Litchman’s home in Albuquerque, NM until 1982.

She was one of four children along with Edward McLean (1905-1982), Josephine ''Jordie'' Elizabeth McLean Kehoe Chilson (1916-1997) and Francis McLean born to Michael George McLean and Antoinette Sauer McLean.  The family appears to have lived in different locations in Colorado and in Santa Fe, New Mexico before finally settling in Denver, Colorado where both Jane and Edward graduated from Cathedral High School.  </p><p>Jane and her brother, Edward first studied ballet with Lillian Cushing in Denver.  Following the lead of her elder brother Edward, who had decided at an early age to become a professional dancer, Jane and Edward McLean began performing ethnic and American Indian based dances in the early 1920s.  The two traveled to NYC in Sept, 1922 with a letter of introduction from B.T.S. Hare of Santa Fe, New Mexico to the noted American modernist painter, Walt Kuhn (1877-1949). Whether this introduction was productive in arranging for them to perform their American Indian dances is not yet known, but it does point out that Jane and Edward McLean were capable of utilizing many acquaintances in order to further their respective dancing careers.  </p><p>The dance company of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, known as Denishawn toured fairly often through Denver, Colorado in years: 1919, 1920, 1922 and 1925.  It is probable that the McLeans saw this company during their Denver performances.  Edward eventually did dance with the Denishawn company during their American tour of 1926-1927.  At this time, Jane continued to study ballet with Luigi Albertieri and Marie Gamberelli (both former teachers of Lillian Cushing) in NYC.  This was a productive period for the brother and sister with Edward traveling to Germany to study German modern dance with Gret Palucca (1929-1931) and touring Europe as a performer of American Indian dances.  Jane gave her first solo recital in NYC at the La Verne Theater under the sponsorship of Martha Graham, Agnes DeMille and John Murray Anderson in 1929.</p><p>From 1927 to 1934 the two siblings also performed together in recitals in Denver, Santa Fe and other cities in the southwest.  In 1931 Edward established a dance school in Kansas City, Kansas.  The two also operated a dancing school of sorts in Santa Fe, New Mexico (1929-1933) and were known for their annual production of the ''Santa Fe Follies'' (1928-1930).  In 1934 Edward McLean severely injured his back during a rehearsal, thereby effectively ending his career.  He went on to study, teach and work as a well known bookbinder for, among others, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Detroit Public Library, Denver Public Library, Duke University and the University of Denver until his death in Ouray, Colorado in 1982.  Jane McLean continued dancing, eventually performing with the Graham Company for two of their concerts.  She was part of the assistant dance group who supported Martha Graham during her ground breaking Carnegie Hall performance on October 11, 1938.  Another member of this group was Betty Bloomer, later Mrs. Gerald R. Ford.  Throughout the remainder of the 1930s and into the 1940s Jane McLean continued to teach and tour as a solo artist across the United States and into Canada.  The motivation for much of her creative output was based on her relationship to Martha Graham and the Graham technique.  In 1949 she reestablished a base in Denver, Colorado and over a five year period worked in the Casper, Wyoming area, where from 1951-1956 she directed a school and established the Jane McLean Dance Company (1949-1954).  Of note was her recognition of contemporary emerging modern dance icons, Merce Cunningham and John Cage.  According to Carolyn Brown's book: ''Chance and Circumstance: Twenty Years with Cage and Cunningham'' (2007), Jane McLean was responsible for arranging for Merce Cunningham to teach a master class in her Denver studio in April 1951.  From 1959 until her death in 1990, Jane McLean continued to teach modern dance, especially the Graham technique in the Denver Metro area.  She was married and divorced from the photographer, Myron Tanenbaum (1912-1987).</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"c7d75cabd1b9566c89a9f9149c289b22","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The collection documents the professional activities of the modern dancer and teacher, Jane McLean and to a lesser extent that of her brother the dancer, Edward McLean.

The originally proposed name was “National Round Dance Board of Governors,” which was later modified to the National Round Dance Board of Review; on July 27, 1977 the Universal Round Dance Council was created, the existing Board was selected as the leadership, and on July 28th the Board voted to change its name to become the Board of Directors of the Universal Round Dance Council (URDC).  The group absorbed the National Carousel Clubs organization in 1999.  In 2007 the bylaws were amended by a membership vote and the URDC officially became the International Choreographed Ballroom Dance Association (ICBDA).</p><p>The original formal proposal for what became the ICBDA was sent from Frank and Iris Gilbert under the auspices of their National Carousels Round Dancing Clubs, Inc., asking selected dance leaders to create a governing body capable of sponsoring conventions dedicated to advanced-level round dancing,  supporting round dancing activities in general, and standardizing the teaching of dance figures across the United States.  The new organization was proposed to start in December of 1976 as the National Round Dance Board of Governors; by May of 1977 the organization was operating as the National Round Dance Board of Review.  </p><p>The first National Round Dance Festival was held from July 28-30,1977 in Kansas City, MO.  It was organized and sponsored by the National Carousel Clubs and the Gilberts, with support from the National Round Dance Board of Review.  On July 27, 1977 a vote was taken by convention attendees to found a new organization, called the Universal Round Dance Council, or URDC, to support round dance events in the future, particularly an ongoing series of national conventions.  Other goals were to improve communication, improve the quality of dance instruction and choreography, and to generally promote the well-being of round dancing as an activity.  Membership would be open to both dancers and teachers, at any level of experience.  The National Round Dance Board of Review was selected to serve as the Board of Directors, with an executive committee; Roy Stier was elected as chairman.  On July 28, 1977, the National Round Dance Board of Review met and officially changed their name to the Board of Directors of the Universal Round Dance Council.  Articles of incorporation and the enactment of bylaw documents were discussed starting at this time, but took until the next convention to be finalized and voted into place at the first official meeting of the Universal Round Dance Council in July of 1978.</p><p>As its primary purpose, in 1977 the URDC immediately took over the National Carousel Clubs' role in planning the convention, which was renamed the National Round Dance Convention for 1978.  The first four conventions were held in Kansas City, MO; since then the location has changed yearly.  The sites with numerous visits are Winston-Salem, NC; San Antonio, TX; San Jose, CA; and Joplin, MO.  Denver, CO and Grand Rapids, MI have each hosted the convention more than once.  The convention name was changed again in 1985 when the 9th Annual Convention was held in Canada and it became the International Round Dance Convention.  Starting in 2008 the International Choreographed Ballroom Dance Association renamed the conventions as the “ICBDA Annual Convention.”  The numbering sequence has remained consistent despite the name changes.</p><p>The Universal Round Dance Council’s second primary activities were publishing a newsletter and a technical manual.  The first semi-monthly newsletter was released in September of 1977, edited by Roy Stier as Executive Chairman.  Sue Riley and her husband Bob took over the editorship beginning with the July, 1981 issue, and she remained editor until 2007.  In February of 1982 the newsletter became titled, “As the World Goes Round.”  Publication of the newsletter was semi-monthly until September of 2004, when it became quarterly.  In September of 2007 the publication’s name became Dancer’s Gazette, and with the first 2008 issue went to a purely digital format.</p><p>The URDC’s goal of promoting quality instruction and choreography was supported with publication in June, 1978 of the URDC Encyclopedia and Reference Manual.  It was continually expanded, revised, updated, and reprinted by the Technical Advisory Board (Technical Advisory Committee starting in October 1987), led by Frank and Iris Gilbert until mid-1985.</p><p>Over the years the URDC and ICBDA have pursued improved relations with other dance organizations, notably Roundalab, and also joined the ARTS coalition.  In 1998-1999 they absorbed the National Carousel Clubs and in 2000 donated a large amount of associated material to the Lloyd Shaw Foundation Archives.</p>","publish":true}],"persistent_id":"26c4f14431a8be4180f10d02820ea0f0","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The collection consists primarily of correspondence and publications from the Universal Round Dance Council, including the organization’s newsletter publication (As the World Goes Round, later renamed Dancer’s Gazette) and convention syllabi from 1977 through August of 2012, plus official convention video recordings from 2004-2006.

Although he was not the first African American to practice law in Colorado, he was the first African-American to pass the Colorado Bar Examination. In 1940 he married Alice Elaine Brown, the daughter of a prominent African-American minister. She graduated from the University of Denver in 1937 and was the first African-American to teach in the Denver public schools. Howard Jenkins, Jr. died in 2003 and was survived by his wife and two sons and a daughter.</p><p>Howard Jenkins became interested in law when he accompanied his best friend to watch his friend's father, Sam Cary, try court cases. Sam Cary was one of the first African-American lawyers in Denver. Jenkins practiced law in Denver until 1946, first in private practice, then in the Denver Office of Price Administration with Edward E. Pringle and Max Melville, then at the Denver War Production Board with James C. Flanigan and Edward Scheunemann. In 1943 Jenkins was appointed Regional Attorney for the National War Labor Board, and in 1945 its Chief Regional Enforcement Officer.  Jenkins then went to work in Washington, D.C. for William Willard Wirtz on the National Wage Stabilization Board, and joined the faculty at Howard University School of Law.  As a law professor he helped prepare briefs for the U.S. Supreme Court to desegregate the railroads and the public schools, including the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. In 1956, Jenkins became the special assistant to the Solicitor of Labor. While special assistant, he was intimately involved in drafting and passing the ''Landrum-Griffin'' Labor Reform Act, known as the ''Employees' Bill of Rights.'' In 1959, Jenkins was named Director of the Office of Regulations at the Bureau of Labor-Management Reports. In 1962, he was named Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau and became the highest-ranking African-American attorney in the federal government. In 1963, Jenkins became the first African-American to be appointed to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) when nominated by President John F. Kennedy. Jenkins was reappointed by three subsequent presidents and served on the NLRB for 20 years.</p><p>Howard Jenkins, Jr. had a substantial impact on labor law during his years of service. His mission was ''to help them discover blacks in the industrial work force, and to get it firmly fixed in our national labor policy that discrimination on the basis of race or sex is an unfair labor practice.'' He wrote the majority opinion in the 1964 watershed case Hughes Tool Co. II, which created unions' duty of fair representation. He also wrote a dissent, affirmed by the courts, holding that it was illegal sex discrimination for unions to have a waiters' union and a separate waitresses' union.</p>","publish":true}],"persistent_id":"b097d4aab27e9c9956fb664baa6b67e9","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Howard Jenkins, Jr. was a labor law attorney who was the first African-American appointed to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board where he served from 1963-1983.

Lincoln Public School in Palisade. His college education at the University of Denver (DU) was interrupted by World War I, in which he served in the air service of the Signal Corps as a corporal and staff sergeant. After the armistice, he returned to the University of Denver and received a Bachelors of Arts degree in 1919. After college he returned to Palisade where he taught, served on the school board and helped operate the family orchard for several years before returning to DU and earning a law degree in 1925. </p><p>Aspinall passed the Colorado Bar in 1925, returned to the Western Slope, and opened a law practice. In addition to his law practice and a continued interest in the family orchard, Aspinall was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Town of Palisade from 1926-1934. He was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1931 and served as Democratic Party Whip in 1931 and 1933 and as Speaker in 1937 and 1938.

His tenure in the House was devoted to representing his district especially in areas of natural resources and water issues. He was Chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, and ex officio member of Subcommittees on Territorial and Insular Affairs, Irrigation and Reclamation, Public Lands, Indian Affairs, Mines and Mining, and National Parks. He was a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Raw Materials.

In 1888, Humphrey Barker Chamberlin offered to finance the building of an observatory for the University. During the next six years, Howe oversaw the building of the Chamberlin Observatory. He picked the location that was far from the smoke and lights of the City of Denver. Chamberlin was financially ruined in the panic of 1893 before the telescope was purchased. Howe made design changes to the telescope to lower the price to $3,000 and then personally borrowed the $3,000 needed even though his salary was only $2,000 a year. Howe went to the manufacturer George Saegmuller in Washington, D.C. to learn how to install the telescope and then took a three week train ride to bring the telescope to the University.

Renaud (1880-1973) began working as a lecturer in Anthropology at the University of Denver in 1920 and remained a faculty member until his retirement in 1948.

In the summer of 1929, Renaud directed a field expedition for the Colorado Museum of Natural History (now the Denver Museum of Nature and Science). He then proceeded with other archaeological surveys of the western High Plains. His archaeology reports were supported not only by the University of Denver, but also by the Smithsonian Institution. After his retirement, he continued to travel, write papers, and give lectures.  The collection reflects Renaud's influence on  archaeological survey methods, showing one of the first attempts at systematic excavations ever made in the western High Plains. Renaud was instrumental in the development of the Anthropology Department at the University of Denver, becoming its first full professor in 1924. When the Mary Reed Building was built in 1932, Renaud designed the space for the Museum of Anthropology. Many of the artifacts collected during Renaud's archaeological fieldwork are part of the museum's collection.

Davidson was born in Eureka, Illinois May 16, 1894, one of four children. Because his grand uncle was past-President of Eureka College, a Christian seminary, Davidson was ''reared in the school's shadow'' with the option of becoming ''either a teacher or a preacher.'' He chose teaching and was awarded his B.A. from Eureka in 1915. A year later he received his A.M. degree from the University of Illinois where he received Phi Beta Kappa honors. In 1917 he earned his M.A. in social science and history at Harvard University.</p><p>During World War I, he served with the Tenth Infantry of the Forty-Sixth Division and also served as an army sergeant in Intelligence. Davidson and his wife Mary, also a graduate of Eureka, were married in 1918. At the end of the war, Davidson simultaneously taught and studied at the University of Michigan where he earned a Ph.D. in languages and literatures in 1922. He arrived in Denver later that year and began teaching at the University of Denver. Before arriving in Colorado, his academic specialty was eighteenth century England. Once in Denver, he realized that Western literature and folklore would be his life work. Davidson taught at the University of Denver until his death in 1957. His course topics ranged from studies of Shakespeare and other English literature, to folklore in the West. He began teaching news writing and eventually founded the journalism department at the University as well as the board of publications and the press club. He was the first faculty member elected to serve as president of the University Senate. In 1940 he became head of the English Department and from March to August 1953 he served as interim Chancellor. At the time of assuming his post, he remarked: ''There is hardly an organization on campus that I have not been connected with at one time or another.''  Davidson was named University Lecturer for 1956. He was also a nationally acclaimed expert in folklore, especially that of Colorado and the West. Davidson was a director of the Colorado State Historical Society, the Modern Languages Association, the American Folklore Society, and the American Dialect Society. He was a charter member of the Denver Posse of the Westerners, an organization devoted to western folklore. In spare moments, Davidson conducted research, wrote outlines for plays, and authored a large number of articles. He contributed to a wide range of magazines from Western American to Shakespeare Quarterly. Additionally,  Davidson authored several books on folklore. The most widely recognized is Rocky Mountain Tales, which presents regional folklore as well as true accounts of early events in the area.

Cutler was born in Putnam, Connecticut on October 8, 1863. In 1893, he graduated from Albion College in Michigan with a Bachelor of Sciences degree. In 1907, he received his Master of Arts degree from the University of Denver and in 1919 Albion College granted him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Ira Cutler married Amelia Perkins of Michigan on August 1, 1894. From 1924 to 1928, he served as national president of the Phi Sigma Society, an honorary biology fraternity.</p><p>In 1898, Cutler joined the faculty of the University of Denver as Professor of Biology and Zoology. In his later years he was noted for his work in the field of ornithology, gathering an assortment of bird species that forms the nucleus of the University’s ornithological collection. He did not limit himself to this field, however. From one of the largest pharmaceutical and botanical gardens in the West, located just north of Warren Avenue on University Boulevard, he supplied multiple botanical retailers and developed new varieties of columbines (including a now lost spurless variety), iris, cacti, and other plants. Producers of digitalis obtained monkshood from this garden. He was both a pioneer and an authority on raising grapes in Colorado. Additionally, he developed hybrids of Indian corn in an experimental plot at the corner of South Josephine and Evans Avenue while working as a government expert from 1916-1920. While visiting the Western Slope, Chancellor Henry Buchtel was given an unusual rose bush. The flowers’ coloring—red centers with yellow petals—coincided with the University’s colors. The Chancellor gave the bush to Cutler who made cuttings of it to plant on the University of Denver campus. After much research, Cutler discovered that the bush, known locally as the ''Denver University Rose'', is more commonly known as the Austrian Copper. Besides studying plants, Cutler investigated the genetics of creepers, a type of fowl, and also studied milk goats. He corresponded with several organizations dedicated to genetics and eugenics. Cutler conducted extensive geological research in the Florissant District of Colorado and taught courses in geology at the University. </p><p>In addition to academic interests, Cutler also enjoyed artistic and community oriented pursuits. He formed a boys club that was to become the first Boy Scout troop west of the Mississippi. During World War I, Cutler turned from professor to commander, becoming staff captain to train the students of the University of Denver’s R.O.T.C. He organized the University of Denver Glee Club in 1900 and directed it for many years, helping the members to successfully tour several surrounding states. He directed the choir at University Park Methodist Episcopal Church, which is located across University Boulevard from the University Park campus. He supervised the publication of the first edition of a book entitled, the Denver University College Songs, which contained several of his own compositions. He wrote the University of Denver alma mater, ''Hail to Denver U.'' Chancellor David Shaw Duncan claimed that Cutler’s paintings ''revealed an artist of merit.'' Cutler utilized this artistic ability in arranging floral decorations for University functions. </p><p>In 1934, Professor Cutler was granted retirement as Professor Emeritus. He died May 25, 1936. The Cutler influence at the University of Denver did not end, however. His daughter Marjorie, who attended the University in the 1920s, became the registrar in 1937 in which capacity she served the University until 1970.

In fact, he waited until his retirement to indulge in his passion for archeology. </p><p>Fallis F. Rees was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on April 19, 1897. He attended Cincinnati public schools and the University of Cincinnati. In 1917 he married Elizabeth Beechgood. They had two children, a son, F. Worth, and a daughter, Katherine. It is not known when he moved to Colorado, but he founded Brick, Inc. in 1932 after working as a sales manager for Denver Pressed Brick Co. He retired in 1962 and began acquiring Indian pottery. His interest soon expanded to ancient artifacts. Those artifacts led to his studying archeology. He became convinced that the similarities between Egyptian art and religion and that of the Mayans and other peoples of ancient America were due to cross-Atlantic contact during the height of Egyptian cultural dominance. In addition to collecting artifacts and art, he began corresponding with archaeologists around the world who were working in areas that complemented Rees' theory. One outcome of his interest was that he completed a manuscript about his research and his theories of cultural contacts in the ancient world. The last years of his life were spent trying to find a publisher for his manuscript, and continuing his artifact collection, which he housed in his Ko-Kas-Ki Museum in Pinedale, Colorado, before transferring it to the University of Denver. His wife helped in the museum as well as accompanying him on his research expeditions to Mexico and South America. </p><p>Rees was a member of the Board of Directors of First Federal Savings and Loan Association, a past Grand Chancellor of Colorado Knights of Pythias, past imperial prince of the Dramatic Order of Knights of Khorassan, a member of the Black Hawk Masonic Lodge No. 16, and a member of the Colorado and New Mexico Archaeological Societies.

The club was established to benefit women and their families living in the Delgany neighborhood. The Social Science Department of the Women's Club of Denver ran a variety of social programs in the Delgany neighborhood ranging from a night school and Traveling Art Gallery to free baths. The Delgany Library was housed in the Railroad Mission at 19th Street and Wewatta Street and it was here that the initial meeting of the Social Union was held during which women resolved to form an organization to meet the needs of the people in the area. Mary C.C. Bradford, a member of the Women's Club of Denver, was later considered the mother of the Social Union because of her help in its early years. She christened the mutual-aid organization 'The Social Union,' a name that was retained until 1921 when it was reorganized as a philanthropic and social organization and renamed 'The Denver Women's Social Union Club.' The Penny Provident Fund, established for members of the Social Union, became the Social Union Savings Bank in 1903 in which club members deposited what savings they could. This money was used as an emergency fund to aid needy members in hard times. Mary C.C. Bradford described the benefits of the Social Union to its members: ''The uplift that the meetings have given to these toil-worn, shut-in lives is incalculable. Vistas of beauty have been opened, stronger thinking stimulated, home problems solved, and best of all, the sense of loving unity established between themselves and their more fortunate sisters.'' (from Some Work of the WCD in A History of the Women's Club of Denver by Mary Sinton)</p><p>Meetings generally consisted of business followed by refreshments and a program. During the meeting, women would suggest those in need whom the organization might assist in one way or another and plan benefits such as cake baking contests or raffles. The money thus earned would go to fund the Union's activities. For example, during 1908-1909, the women of the Social Union made visits to homes and hospitals and delivered bouquets, jellies, fruits, bundles of clothing, a total of eight tons of coal, and 14 dollars to the sick and needy. ''We also have endeavored to answer every call of sickness and distress that has come to us, as well as to visit every member of the S.U. who has been ill.'' (from Minutes 1908-1916) The programs were organized by individual members and included a variety of presentations. For example, one meeting on March 29, 1923 included a talk by Mary C.C. Bradford, who gave an ''account of [the] compulsory educational bill and urged women to sign it,'' followed by a program of ''fancy dancing'' presented by Virginia Jardt and Janice Goalstone. (from Minutes 1923-1924) </p><p>The last meeting of the Denver Women's Social Union Club was held in 1973 and the remaining 25 members decided to close the books on November 4, 1977 ''due to [the fact that] many of our faithful members passed on.'' (from Minutes 1957-1973).</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"62adb93ec3b1fb6cea70e5d4dbe395f1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Denver Women's Social Union Club, a club for poor and working-class women, was founded as a mutual-aid society in 1898 by members of the social science department of the Women's Club of Denver for the benefit of women in the Delgany neighborhood.

At the request of Chancellor Chester Alter, Marion Gottesfeld (Hurwitz) and Peg Bradford, both University trustees, formed a committee to raise funds for the University's libraries and to acquire book donations and manuscript collections to support University research and teaching. This committee, composed of seven other members, including Mrs. Harry Bellamy, Mrs. Horace Bennett, Mrs. David Chalmers, Mrs. Dayton Denious, Mrs. William Iliff, Mrs. Sam Levy, and Mrs. Harold Webster (Frances), organized an initial campaign that resulted in significant contributions to the Mary Reed Library. </p><p>In 1958, the Women's Committee of the University of Denver became the Women's Committee for the Library, also known as the Women's Library Committee. Under the leadership of Marion Gottesfeld (Hurwitz) the activities of the group were expanded, and the organization set out to build the library's collections through the solicitation of donations from organized women's groups and individuals, and the creation of a memorial book program. The new committee's enthusiasm and commitment was summed up in a 1959 Denver Post article, in which Marion Gottesfeld, referring to the Mary Reed Library, stated that, ''a woman built this library so it's up to the women of the community to keep it up.''</p><p>By 1965 the Women's Library Committee had grown to over 130 members and their impact was strongly felt, as they were responsible for acquiring seventy percent of the gifts made to the University of Denver libraries from 1964-1965. To reward this dedicated work a new organization was formed in December 1965 by proclamation of University Chancellor Dr. Chester M. Alter. The Women's Library Committee was renamed the Women's Library Association, with its own bylaws and Executive Board. Marion Gottesfeld (Hurwitz) was named the first Executive Chair, with Janet Pirkey appointed as the general chair of the Annual Support program. The new organization was designed to involve a greater number of women from the Denver community. They hoped to reach this goal with the Annual Support program, which recruited women to become Sustaining, Associate, and Contributing members of the WLA. Members were eligible to attend a series of educational lectures, which became the WLA Lecture Series, presented by University faculty and community leaders. </p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s the organization developed several creative events. Some of the most notable include the annual Art and Antique auction, the Bargain Bazaar garage sale, the WLA cookbook A Stirring Experience, Mansions in Miniature (a miniature collectible show and sale), the Craftskeller gift shop (a store for students in the student union), and the annual spring book sale. Along with providing funding for books and manuscript collections, the work of the Women's Library Association also reached more widely into campus affairs. They had a representative on the committee to select the architect for Penrose Library, which opened in 1972. In addition, they sponsored many special events on campus, including a reception in 1964 for U Thant, Secretary General of the United Nations, and an exhibit in Penrose library of the University's collection of prints by photographer Edward S. Curtis in 1975. </p><p>Today, the Women's Library Association remains an important source of support for the University of Denver Libraries.

Born in Czechoslovakia on September 20, 1909, he studied at the Sorbonne in Paris before receiving a Doctor of Law Degree from Charles University, Prague in 1933, with emphasis on international relations. He began his diplomatic career with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prague in 1934. In 1937 he was appointed Press and Cultural Attaché of the Czechoslovak Legation in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.</p><p>After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, he escaped with his family to London, where he joined the Czechoslovak government in exile. He served as personal secretary to Jan Masaryk until 1940 when he became head of the broadcasting department. </p><p>After the war, Korbel returned to Czechoslovakia, where he served as Chef de Cabinet to Masaryk, and helped organize the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prague. He also served on the Czechoslovak delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. His next appointment was as Ambassador to Yugoslavia. That appointment ended with the take over of the Czechoslovak government by the communists. The Korbels were forced to leave Czechoslovakia once again, and made their way to New York City. Korbel had been appointed by the Czechoslovak government to a United Nations Commission on India and Pakistan. The staff of the United Nations persuaded Korbel to continue to serve the Commission as long as possible, which he did. He served as chairman and delivered the first commission report to the U.N. Security Council before pressure from the government in Prague forced his retirement from the Commission in 1949.</p><p>A connection to the United Nations brought Josef Korbel to the United States and then to Denver and the University. It was at that point that Korbel began his career at the University of Denver, being named Professor in International Relations and a staff member of the Social Sciences Foundation. In 1959 he was appointed Dean of the Graduate School of International Studies and Director of the Social Science Foundation, thereby adding his leadership to one of the outstanding programs in world affairs. He then served as Dean of the Graduate School of International Studies and Director of the Social Science Foundation, and was named the first Andrew W. Mellon Professor of International Studies in 1969. His tenure at DU was marked by an active teaching and writing schedule, which included mentoring such students as his daughter, Madeline Albright, and Condoleezza Rice. During his years at DU, Korbel also served as visiting professor at such institutions as MIT, Harvard, Columbia, and Oxford. According to his own assessment, Korbel was fluent in four languages, good in two more and had a good reading knowledge of an additional two. That grasp of languages aided him in his research, which led to six books and numerous articles, dealing primarily with Eastern Europe and Cold War diplomacy. </p><p>In addition to his international reputation, Korbel is remembered at the University of Denver as an outstanding teacher and scholar. His students remember a caring teacher who was generous with his time. His colleagues remembered him as nurturing and supportive. All who knew him at the University of Denver remembered him as a person who enjoyed good food and good company and loved good conversation, especially over the dinner table. He looked forward to the future with the experience of his past, but was never bitter about what had happened to him and his family. When he died of cancer in 1977, he was honored by his colleagues and students in a special ceremony, and by the University with the establishment of the Josef Korbel Memorial Scholarship.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"b63939d9093939fcfd1fb33374a9a69d","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Korbel papers at the University of Denver cover the years from 1949-1967 that Josef Korbel spent at the University of Denver, Denver, Colorado and consists of correspondence between Josef Korbel and various people regarding his research and publications on the problems of Kashmir and on the relations of the satellite republics with the Soviet Union.

She was the fifth of nine children of Frederick W. and Catherine (McGurk) White. At the time of her birth, Spencer's father was a writer for and part owner of the Albany Union. He had entered the field of journalism shortly after his marriage and during the early years of his career wrote for the New York Sun and edited the Albany Express. Eventually the family left New York and moved to Denver. Frederick White became famous in the West and throughout the country as an editorial writer, critic, and essayist for the Denver Post, under the initials ''F.W.W.''</p><p>Spencer followed her father into journalism after attending a series of French convent schools from which she graduated at age 15. She worked briefly with him at the Denver Post and later held a civic job for a few months before she married George Soule Spencer and left Denver.</p><p>During her marriage Spencer lived in New York City. Her husband was an actor, and her writing centered around the theater in the form of play reviews, script revisions, and the writing of plays. A full-length play and several one-act plays were produced. At this time she also wrote movie scenarios, many of which were accepted by the Edison and Vitagraph Companies. </p><p>After the deaths of her parents, Frederick in February 1917 and Catherine in March 1918, and the end of her marriage, Spencer returned to Denver. It was at this time that she made her first attempts at verse. The subjects she wrote about most often were Indian life and Colorado. She used these themes repeatedly in her poetry, pageant writing, prose and public addresses in schools and over the radio. In addition, Spencer was interested in astronomy. She was a member of the Astronomical Society of France and published a textbook for the Nutshell Science series of Chicago called Astronomy Without a Telescope. Some of her best known works were her translations of French poems of which more than 50 were published, many of which won awards. </p><p>Spencer was best known in the Denver area as a writer of pageants. ''Hymn to Colorado'' (music by Mrs. Forrest Rutherford) was performed in April 1926 by 6,000 Denver school children. In June of the same year her ''Indian Prologue'' (music by Henry Sachs) was presented at the University of Denver. ''The Pageant of Colorado'' (music by Charles Wakefield Cadman), was presented in Denver in May 1927 with a cast of 1500, and was said to have been the largest indoor spectacle ever produced in the West. It was part of a celebration honoring the opening of the Moffat Tunnel. Finally, the ''Pageant of York'' (music by Urban Hershey), was presented in October 1927 in York, Pennsylvania. This pageant used a cast of 5000 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Continental Congress in York. The pageant was published in book form by the city of York and later by Dodd-Mead in their National Pageant Series (October 1929). </p><p>A story in Spencer's poem ''Blue Feather'' inspired a collaboration with Charles Sanford Skilton on the opera The Sun Bride, produced by the National Broadcasting Company on April 17, 1930. The Sun Bride was also presented as a poetic drama at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver in July 1935 by Marion Parsons Robinson of the University of Denver. </p><p>After 1930, Spencer's efforts turned from writing to getting poems and translations already written published in book form or republished in magazines. In 1944, she and her brother Frank E. White sold the family home at 1490 Stuart Street in Denver and moved to Oceanside, California. It was there that she died on June 23, 1953.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"e4af035b0f7d04bf0efbbbdf74c56532","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Lilian White Spencer (1876-1953) was a playwright and poet.

Early Dawn is particularly well documented, with drafts and correspondence between Porter and Normand Lockwood revealing how a librettist and a composer collaborate to create a work of art.

Arthur Chapman, a long-time Denver newspaperman, is probably best remembered as the author of ''Out Where the West Begins,'' a poem detailing a sense of the West. John Chapman grew up around the newspaper business, starting a paper route as soon as he was old enough. Beginning in high school he worked as a reporter for the Denver Times, the paper at which his father was employed. He also worked as a shelver at a public library and was one of the Forest Service workers who built roads in Woodland Park.</p><p>After graduating from East High School in 1917, his education was irregular. He completed his freshman year at the University of Colorado before spending a year working at the Denver Times. When the family moved to New York, John Chapman entered Columbia (now Columbia University), but never graduated. It wasn't until 1959 that he received an honorary Doctor of Humanities from the University of Denver. On July 31, 1923, John Chapman married Georgia Christina Andrews, also a Denver native. They had one daughter, Karin, who settled in Denver. </p><p>Once in New York, Chapman found a job as a reporter and photographer for the New York Illustrated Daily News. In 1924, the Pacific and Atlantic Photo Bureau, a picture syndicate including the Daily News, sent him to be the Paris manager. Upon returning to New York in 1926, he rejoined the Daily News staff and was mentored by Burns Mantle, a respected theater critic and city editor. Chapman began writing his extremely popular column, ''Mainly About Manhattan,'' which not only provided gossip concerning various city celebrities, but also made Chapman into a celebrity in his own right. He spent two years (1940-1942) in Hollywood, sending newsy and tongue-in-cheek articles back to the Daily News. </p><p>After returning to New York and serving as the night picture editor for a short time, Chapman replaced Burns Mantle as drama critic for the Daily News. He held this post until shortly before his death. His reviews were witty and acerbic, and have often been compared to the writings of H.L. Mencken. On Mae West's performance in Catherine the Great, Chapman wrote, ''I'm afraid Catherine the Great will be a bust, which is one more than Miss West needs.'' In another review, Chapman described Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as being ''three hours long, four characters wide, and cesspool deep.'' Chapman always edited his own work so no one would know his opinion of a show until his review appeared in the paper. His nickname ''Old Frostface'' came from his ability to give no outward reaction to a play, whether he found it hilarious, moving, or dreadful. </p><p>In addition to his regular reviews, Chapman worked as a freelance writer for several other publications. He was commissioned to write Tell it to Sweeney, an informal history of the New York Daily News. He was also selected to edit the Best Plays series from 1947 until 1952, and Broadway's Best from 1957 to 1960. He belonged to numerous organizations including the New York Drama Circle and the Dutch Treat Society, a well-known organization of New York talents in the arts. He served as president of each of these organizations. The Fairfield County Hunt Club listed him among its members. </p><p>Late in 1971, Chapman underwent surgery for cancer, from which he never expected to recover. He died January 19, 1972 and was cremated according to his wishes.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"60559467d96f5d9c1037137db2dddb84","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The bulk of the collection dates from John A.

He attended Berlin's Humboldt University, studying theoretical physics, mathematics, and biology. After graduating, Yourgrau stayed at Humboldt to pursue a Ph.D. in physics, which he earned in 1932. While in Berlin, he also studied under Albert Einstein and was awarded the prestigious Einstein Medal in 1970 by the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation for his work in the field of relativity.</p><p>With the Nazi rise to power in 1933, Yourgrau's staunchly anti-fascist position made him a target for harassment, so he fled Germany and was permitted to enter Palestine as a political refugee. In Palestine, Dr. Yourgrau lectured widely for the Jewish Federation of Labor while holding several teaching posts. In 1942 British authorities granted Yourgrau a license to publish The Orient, an independent German-language weekly that endeavored to quash ''every fascist movement, every attempt to restrict the right of free expression....'' The periodical was forced to cease operations when it encountered threats, boycotts, and the destruction of its office space. Undeterred by the violence, Yourgrau sought a more active role in the fight against the Axis powers, so he began editing German publications and broadcasts for the British government.</p><p>After the war, Yourgrau resumed his academic career as Head of the Department of Logic and Scientific Method at Jerusalem's School of Higher Studies. In 1948 he married Thella Garber and emigrated to South Africa, where he taught at several universities. The Yourgraus moved to the United States in 1959.</p><p>In 1963 Dr. Yourgrau left his position as Chair of the Department of History and Science at Smith College to accept a permanent post as Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Denver. He later served as the Chair of the Philosophy Department at the University of Denver and was with the School's History Department before retiring in 1978.</p><p>Dr. Yourgrau was prolific as a scholar, contributing dozens of journal articles and reviews, lecturing internationally, and producing several monographs. Among his best known books are Variational Principles in Dynamics and Quantum Theory (1961) and A Treatise on Irreversible and Statistical Thermophysics (1966).

He envisioned a public opinion research center that would not attempt to make predictions or sell products, as most market research organizations did, but would give a voice to ordinary people.  With his experience working for George Gallup and support from the Field Foundation and the University of Denver, Field was able to make his dream a reality.  In October, 1941 the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) was incorporated as a nonprofit institution.  Harry Field insisted that each interviewer who collected opinions be hired in person (rather than by written application) so that only those best suited to working with a variety of people would be hired.  He also required that they receive adequate training before being sent into the field to gather information.  In 1947, Clyde W. Hart became the director of NORC.  Under his supervision, the organization moved to the University of Chicago.  He left behind a wing, called Opinion Research Center (ORC), to gather data and work on studies from the Denver campus.

He was involved in the Fellowship of Reconciliation, and was secretary of the Association to Abolish War from 1920 to 1927.

He attended Asbury (now DePauw) University in Greencastle, Indiana, for one year, after which he worked in a wholesale drug-house in Chicago, and then in a wholesale and retail grocery business in South Bend, Indiana. Finding himself drawn to the ministry, he returned to Asbury University to finish his studies to become a Methodist minister.</p><p>He received his A.B. degree in 1872. Soon after graduation he married Mary Stevenson, and began his ministry as a missionary to Bulgaria. He returned to Indiana to take a pastorate in Zionsville, and subsequently served churches in Greencastle, Knightstown, Richmond and Lafayette, Indiana. In 1885 he was called to be the minister at the Evans Chapel in Denver, Colorado. During his five-year pastorate in Denver, he built Trinity Church and substantially increased the size of the congregation. He returned East in 1891 to serve churches in New York and New Jersey. In 1899 he was called by the University of Denver to serve as Chancellor, which post he began on January 1, 1900. When Buchtel assumed the position of Chancellor, the University of Denver was greatly in debt. Buchtel worked diligently to rectify the situation, touring the state giving speeches and sermons, and becoming involved in the Denver Chamber of Commerce. Within three years he had raised enough money to cover the University's debt, and had more than doubled the student body. Buchtel's tenure at the University was also marked by an aggressive building campaign. He oversaw the construction of the Library (funded by Andrew Carnegie), Science Hall, the Memorial Chapel (later named Buchtel Chapel), and the Gymnasium. In 1906, Buchtel was persuaded to run for Governor of Colorado on the Republican ticket. Political infighting in the Democratic Party leadership helped to ensure Buchtel's victory. He served the state from 1907 to 1909, while continuing to work as Chancellor of the University. Despite his successful term as Governor, he declined to run again in 1909, electing to devote his full energies to the University of Denver. Buchtel suffered a stroke in 1920 that forced his retirement from his position as Chancellor.

The collection reflects the Deardorffs' interest in genealogy. It includes genealogy research conducted by Charles Deardorff on the Richardson family, and Deardorff’s autobiography.  The collection includes diaries (1861-1864), a diploma and a stamp collection.  The collection also includes correspondence, postcards, an address book, recipes, receipts, a history, newspaper clippings, notes, a speech, memorabilia, photographs, and glass plate negatives. There is no clear indication of which member of the family compiled the collection of religious tracts, but several are inscribed as the property of Alice Richardson Deardorff.

She was the second of two daughters born to William John Suckow and Anna Mary (Kluckholm), children of German immigrants. William Suckow was a Congregationalist minister in various Iowa towns throughout his life. Anna Suckow was limited in her duties as a minister's wife due to a thyroid disorder, thus she focused her ambitions on her husband and daughters Emma and Ruth. As a child, Ruth accompanied her father on his calls throughout the Iowa countryside where she became acquainted with people who would later serve as models for characters in her writings. From an early age Ruth composed stories that she folded into small books that she decorated.</p><p>Suckow attended schools in Algona, Fort Dodge, Manchester, and Grinnell, Iowa, graduating from high school in Grinnell in 1910. She entered Grinnell College in 1910, where she specialized in English and appeared in many theatrical productions. While at Grinnell, Suckow worked for one summer as a waitress at Yellowstone National Park. She left Grinnell in 1913 to attend the Curry School of Expression in Boston, from which she graduated in 1915. Suckow then moved to Denver, where she joined her sister, Emma, who had recently moved from Iowa to seek relief from tuberculosis. Ruth Suckow enrolled at the University of Denver, where, as a student of English, she received a Bachelor of Arts in 1917 and a Master of Arts in 1918. As a graduate student, Suckow was an assistant to Dr. Ida Kruse McFarlane, head of the English Department at the University. Suckow spent the summer of 1918 employed as a waitress at Long's Peak Lodge in Estes Park, Colorado, accompanied by a friend and former student, Amy Carlson (later Mrs. Amy Buchanan).</p><p>While at the University of Denver, Ruth Suckow decided upon a writing career. Her first published writings were poems that appeared in 1918 in Touchstone and The Midland. She worked during the winter of 1918-1919 as a writer of automobile guide books for a Denver map company. At this time, Suckow decided to take up beekeeping as a steady source of income as she began to pursue her writing career. After a brief apprenticeship in beekeeping under Delia Watson, Suckow left Denver in 1919 to join her recently widowed father in Earlville, Iowa. There she established the Orchard Apiary at the edge of town. The venture was quite successful until sold by Suckow late in 1926. During this time, she lived in Earlville and McGregor, Iowa and spent winters in Chicago, Iowa City, and New York City.</p><p>The first story published by Ruth Suckow, ''Uprooted'', appeared in the February 1921 issue of The Midland. Suckow served as assistant editor of The Midland for a half year in 1921-1922. The editor of The Midland, John T. Frederick, urged her to send work to H. L. Mencken, who encouraged, criticized, and promoted Ruth Suckow as a writer. She frequently contributed to Mencken's publication, The Smart Set, between 1921 and 1923. In 1924, Suckow's novella, ''Country People,'' was serialized in The Century Magazine and was published by Alfred A. Knopf later that year. Knopf published The Odyssey of a Nice Girl in 1925, and a collection of her 1921-1926 stories under the title Iowa Interiors in 1926. Meanwhile, Suckow also contributed articles to The American Mercury (1924-1927, 1929).</p><p>After selling the Orchard Apiary in 1926, Suckow moved to New York City, where she lived until 1928. Knopf published The Bonney Family in 1928. Suckow contributed articles to Harper's Monthly Magazine (1927-1929, 1936, 1939), The Bookman (1927), The Saturday Review of Literature (1927), and The Outlook (1929).</p><p>In September 1928, Suckow moved to San Diego with her fiancée, Ferner Nuhn, a writer and critic also from Iowa. They were married on March 11, 1929 and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico where they lived until November of the same year. While Suckow was in Santa Fe, Cora was published and her articles appeared not only in such literary publications as Harper's Monthly Magazine and The American Mercury, but also in popular publications such as Good Housekeeping (1929-1931, 1935) and Pictorial Review (1929). Suckow and Nuhn returned to Iowa in late 1929 and remained there through part of 1930. The Kramer Girls appeared serialized in Good Housekeeping from December 1929 through March 1930, and was published as a book by Knopf later in 1930. Suckow and her husband lived in Dorset, Vermont in 1930-1931, where their friends included Dorothy Canfield Fisher and her family. A collection of short stories first published in 1925-1929 appeared in 1931 as Children and Older People. Ruth and Ferner returned to Iowa in 1931 and resided in Cedar Falls (1931-1932) and in Des Moines (1932-1933). Suckow was a guest instructor at Iowa State Teacher's College, University of Iowa, and Indiana University during this time, and devoted considerable time to writing her most famous and ambitious novel, The Folks. In the latter half of 1933, Suckow and Nuhn lived at the MacDowell Memorial Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire and at Artists' Colony, Yaddo, Saratoga Springs, New York, and spent a portion of 1934 in Altadena, California.</p><p>The Folks was published by Farrar & Rinehart in 1934 and became one of the most popular books of the year. Around this time, Ferner Nuhn began writing pamphlets and other material for the Department of Agriculture, and the couple moved to Washington, D. C., where they lived for a year. Suckow wrote her first short stories in three years, which appeared in Good Housekeeping and Scribner's in 1935. Later in 1935, Ruth and Ferner moved to Fairfax, Virginia after spending the summer at Robert Frost's home in South Shaftsbury, Vermont. In 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Ruth Suckow to the Farm Tenancy Committee.</p><p>After a collection of Suckow's short stories was published by Farrar & Rinehart in 1936 under the title, Carry Over, she wrote less frequently. In late 1936, Suckow and Nuhn moved to Cedar Falls, Iowa, where they remained until 1948. Two stories by Suckow were published in 1939 and Farrar & Rinehart published the book New Hope in 1942. Nuhn devoted himself to writing, The Wind Blew from the East, also published in 1942. The couple also operated a rental agency and encouraged local interest in literature and the arts.</p><p>Ruth and Ferner were pacifists who supported conscientious objectors during World War II. Under the sponsorship of the American Friends Service Committee, Church of the Brethren, and the Mennonites, Suckow spoke, visited, and read manuscripts at civilian public service camps, units in mental hospitals, firefighting units, and starvation units. The couple later became active members of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Because Suckow began to develop arthritis, they moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1948. In 1952, they moved to Claremont, California, where they bought a home. The first Suckow book to appear in a decade, Some Others and Myself, was published by Rinehart & Company in 1952. Over the next few years, Suckow wrote stories which appeared in Midland Schools (1953), Friends Intelligencer (1955), and The Georgia Review (1955, 1958). Her last book, The John Wood Case, was published by The Viking Press in 1959. Ruth Suckow died in Claremont, California on January 23, 1960.</p>","publish":true}],"persistent_id":"e2f8e44389378a890ab4e55c523388c6","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","type":"scopecontent","subnotes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Ruth Suckow's papers primarily consists of letters, notes, and postcards from Suckow to Amy (Carlson) Buchanan written between 1918 and 1960.

After he graduated in 1903, Johnson became a train dispatcher in Fairmont, Nebraska.</p><p>In 1909 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was advised to go to Colorado. He and his wife of two years, the former Fern Claire Armitage, moved to Colorado, first to Fountain and then to a homestead near Craig. He ranched, managed a farmers’ cooperative milling elevator, and taught school before being elected to the Colorado Legislature in 1922. He moved on to the Colorado Senate for the 1931-1932 session, and was elected Governor of Colorado as a Democrat for the first time in 1933. Faced with the problems of the Great Depression, he initiated his own recovery program on tax reduction, highway and construction projects, balanced budget legislation, and civil service reform. Despite the success of his program, Johnson created controversy in 1936 when he called out the National Guard to prevent Mexican farm workers from entering Colorado. Bowing to the pressure of federal and state officials, he reversed his stance. </p><p>After two terms as Governor, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, taking office in 1937. He continued to be known as an isolationist, opposing America’s involvement in foreign wars. He was a strong supporter of people in the military and, as Vice-Chair of the Military Affairs Committee, was instrumental in the creation of the G.I. Bill of Rights, Lowry Air Force Base, and the U.S. Air Force Academy. Once the United States entered World War II, Johnson was fully behind the war effort. </p><p>After the War, Johnson was instrumental in creating the interstate highway system in Colorado, especially I-70. He supported atomic energy and its effect on Colorado uranium mining, and he was very interested in both reclamation projects and oil shale development.

Love was born November 29, 1916 in Illinois. When he was a child, his family moved to Colorado and settled in Colorado Springs in hopes of curing his father's respiratory illness. He graduated from The Cheyenne Mountain School in 1934 and then proceeded to the University of Denver, where he earned a B.A. degree in 1938 and a law degree in 1941. He was on the staff of the University of Denver student newspaper, The Clarion, and served as editor his senior year. He also served as president of the Rocky Mountain Collegiate Press Association. World War II found Love in the U.S. Navy Aviation program. He was a pilot of amphibious bombers for over two years, earning two Distinguished Flying Crosses and the Air Medal with clusters. After the war he returned to Colorado Springs and opened a law practice, specializing in civil and corporate law.</p><p>Love was a political neophyte when he was elected governor of Colorado in 1962. It was his first elective office, but the Colorado Springs lawyer used his platform of lower taxes to defeat the incumbent, Stephen McNichols. He made good on this promise to lower taxes. During his three terms as governor, he was active in promoting Colorado throughout the United States. The tourist industry boomed during his tenure, as did the ski industry. With the support of Governor Love, Colorado was proposed as a host for the 1976 Winter Olympics. That opportunity was abandoned when, in 1972, a referendum refused to allow any state money to be used to stage the games. Love was a political moderate. His term in office saw increased funding for education as well as important water and air pollution legislation. In 1967, he signed the first state law in the U.S. legalizing abortion, and later approved the ''Sunshine Law,'' which opened government meetings to the public. </p><p>In 1973, Love resigned as governor to serve as the first Director of the Office of Energy Policy under President Richard M. Nixon. He left that position after five months and returned to Colorado and the private sector. He served on the Board of Directors and as CEO of Ideal Basic Industries, a cement manufacturer, as well as counsel to the Denver law firm of Davis, Graham & Stubbs. He also taught history at the University of Northern Colorado, and served multiple terms on the Board of Trustees of the University of Denver.</p><p>Love married Ann Daniels in 1942.

In July 1924 he finished his master’s degree in Education and Speech at the University of Iowa. His first teaching job was at the high school in Ord, Nebraska, in 1922-1923. He then worked at Abraham Lincoln High School in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Midland College, and Purdue University. He was awarded the third speech Ph.D. in the country at the University of Iowa in February 1931, with an emphasis on the Psychology of Speech.</p><p>In 1931 he obtained perhaps the only speech position available during that year of the Depression, Associate Professor of Speech and Dramatic Arts at the University of Denver. He became chairman of the department the next year. The publishing of his first book, a joining of speech with personality development, The Speech Personality (Lippincott, 1937, 1942) brought many advanced students to the University. The first Ph.D. in Speech was offered in 1945 with the assistance of the growing faculty and administration. In December 1949 Murray initiated the founding of the National Society for the Study of Communication, later called the International Communication Association. In 1939 he participated in the first of his five seminars with Alfred Korzybski in Chicago. Jointly with M. (Marjorie) Kendig he programmed the 1942 and 1950 congresses in general semantics held at the University of Denver. Integrative Speech (Dryden Press, 1952) was one of the first textbooks to introduce general semantics in the teaching of communication. In 1950 he introduced the first Laboratory in Interpersonal Communication in the country. This was followed in 1964 with an Interdisciplinary Analogue Laboratory on Structures, Patterns and Themes. Primarily for graduate students, teachers and administrators in higher education, the Laboratory was designed to explore analogous structures and systems of knowledge across the sciences and humanities in order to create greater understanding of the whole of human knowledge. </p><p>Murray retired from the School of Speech in 1962, although he continued to be involved in the department afterward. He held visiting professor appointments at a number of other universities, was the joint programmer of six interdisciplinary conferences, and presented papers at a number of others.

He performed odd jobs for the newspaper as a boy, and began his career with Scripps-Howard at the age of 15, writing sports articles for the Cleveland Press. When Scripps-Howard bought the Rocky Mountain News in 1926, Foster was transferred to Denver, where he worked for the News as a reporter, feature writer and book reviewer. Three years later he was transferred to the New York Telegram, where he worked as the radio editor. In 1931 he was promoted to assistant city editor. He contracted tuberculosis in 1933, and was unable to resume his career until 1937, when he became a feature writer for the New York World-Telegram. He was later promoted to assistant executive editor.</p><p>While at the New York World-Telegram he met and married Frances Magnum, who was the paper's fashion editor. In 1940 the couple moved to Denver, where Foster assumed the reins of the Rocky Mountain News as editor and chief executive officer. At that time the News faced stiff competition from its rival Denver newspaper, the Denver Post, and was in danger of losing the fight. In 1942 Foster made a bold move to save the dying paper. After convincing the president of Scripps-Howard, Roy W. Howard, of the soundness of the plan, Foster changed the format of the paper from the traditional broadside to a tabloid, magazine-style format. The new format debuted on April 13, 1942, and is largely credited with saving the dying paper. At the same time, Foster introduced another novel idea, the advice column. The Molly Mayfield column was the first advice column of its kind, pre-dating Ann Landers and Dear Abby. Foster's wife Frances penned the column under the pseudonym. Instantly popular with the airmen at Lowry Field, it soon gained a city-wide readership, followed by everyone from housewives to university professors.</p><p>Foster had a long and illustrious career at the News. He was well-regarded in the newspaper business, influential in the Denver area and well-known in political circles. He served on the American Society of Newspaper Editors' Pulitzer Prize selection panel, and kept up a lively correspondence with Dwight D. Eisenhower for a number of years. Under his guidance the News moved from a paper on the brink of closing to one with the largest circulation of any Scripps-Howard newspaper.</p><p>Foster retired from the Rocky Mountain News at the end of 1970.

In June of 1910 he graduated from the University of Denver with a B.A. degree in History.

He returned to the University of Denver as an instructor in the fall of 1918, teaching history and plane trigonometry. After a few years he moved to teaching full time in the combined Department of History and Political Science. In 1935 he attained the rank of full professor, and the combined department was divided, with Scofield taking over the chairmanship of the History Department. He retired in 1955, and became Professor Emeritus at the University of Denver.

Dominick Papers at the University of Denver primarily pertain to his years in the U. S. Senate.  Each congressional session represents a separate series. Each of these series contains material pertaining to the functions and activities performed and subjects covered during the session, filed in a set order. The order begins with Administrative and Personal information. This is followed by Political Affairs, which includes both local and national political information. Public Relations is the next category, which includes messages from colleagues and constituents, condolences and congratulations, publicity material, correspondence with friends and constituents about visits to Washington, D.C., and thank you letters. The next category is Domestic Policy, followed by Foreign Policy. These two categories were very large in the early years of Dominick's tenure in Washington, and contain policy statements on a number of issues. Unlike many senators, Dominick did not limit his correspondence to his own constituents, and thus this correspondence contains opinions and commentary from all over the United States and abroad. In the later years, this correspondence was contained mainly in other correspondence until finally, in the 1973-74 congressional term, the correspondence to Dominick was no longer saved, and only his statements on certain policies were saved as paragraphs to be added to letters on the subjects.   These general categories are followed by Departments -- government departments, correspondence with them and with constituents who were concerned with the workings of the departments. In this category are found Constituent Agency Contacts (C.A.C.) files. These files contain requests from constituents for information or help in dealing with departments. There is a fine line between some of the C.A.C.s and Cases, but in general the C.A.C.s are items that can be handled by a letter or decision, while the Cases are more personal and contain more private information needed to work with a particular agency -- usually the military or benefits agencies.   Agencies comprise the next category, and generally include correspondence and information similar to the Departments, but directed to specific agencies within the federal government.    A small category of the State of Colorado follows, containing correspondence with the State and with constituents who want Dominick's help in influencing the State. This is followed by the District of Columbia category, which contains information about the running of the District government. This category's size varies, reflecting Dominick's involvement with the Senate oversight committee.   The Legislation category concludes the filing system for each session. Bills and Resolutions sponsored or co-sponsored by Dominick are listed first. The legislation files contain correspondence and work files on the legislation that was being considered in a given congressional session.   The other series in the collection cover other aspects of Dominick's work, generally divided by material type. Series 1 includes all material from Dominick's life prior to his election to Congress in 1962. Series 2 through 7 cover the congressional terms.

They discussed mutual interests, calling themselves ''Committee for the Concerns of Women in New England College and Universities'' (the Concerns Committee). This Committee drafted a proposal to create a referral service for women with appropriate qualifications for faculty and administrative jobs. In 1972 they received a modest grant from the Ford Foundation to create Project HERS (Higher Education Resource Services) at Brown University, which offered referral and placement services, career counseling workshops, and administrative training seminars. The Project had a dual mission – to improve the opportunities and status of academic professional women and to aid colleges and universities in compliance with the requirements of Title IX (of the Education Amendments of 1972) that mandated an end to discrimination based on gender in employment.</p><p>In 1976 Project HERS moved from Brown University to Wellesley College, again with support from the Ford Foundation. HERS, New England responded to the needs of women in the job market; they sponsored career counseling workshops and started the Management Institute for Women in Higher Education at Wellesley College. The Management Institute, originally supported by the Fund for the Improvement for Post-Secondary Education, is a series of five weekend seminars focused on teaching administrative skills. </p><p>Project HERS was so successful that the Ford Foundation granted further funding to establish HERS, Mid-Atlantic at the University of Pennsylvania in 1974 as a separate administrative unit. It was conceived of as a sister organization that would move beyond the referral function to offer an increasing range of services. In 1975, Director Cynthia Secor proposed a residential program co-sponsored with Bryn Mawr College to offer appropriate administrative training for women seeking advancement in higher education. The Summer Institute for Women in Higher Education Administration started in 1976 and was initially funded by a three-year grant from the William H. Donner Foundation. By 1978, the Institute was self supporting and continues to enroll participants, over 2,100 by 2005. </p><p>HERS, West was started at the University of Utah in 1979 for professional women in intermountain states, again with funding from the Ford Foundation. </p><p>In 1983, HERS, Mid-Atlantic relocated from the University of Pennsylvania to the University of Denver and was renamed HERS, Mid-America.</p><p>In addition to the Summer Institute and Management Institute, HERS has developed new programs. In the 1990s HERS and the National Associate of Collegiate Women and Athletic Administrators (NACWAA) teamed up to cosponsor the Institute for Administrative Advancement (IAA). The IAA offers week long seminars for women coaches and athletic administrators, including intensive training in athletic administration. The HERS-South Africa Seminar also started in the late 1990s. It was funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and allowed over seventy South African women to travel to the United States and participate in trainings for women in higher education administration. The HERS-South Africa office is located in Cape Town and it continues to offer workshops as well as a week-long HERS-South Africa Academy.</p><p> HERS, Mid-America is housed at the University of Denver in the University’s  Merle C. Chambers Center for Women building.</p><p>All of the offices in the HERS network are involved in other activities to promote women, particularly women in higher education administration. These include working with women on career mapping and guidance; collaboration with other organizations, colleges and universities; attending and presenting in conferences; publishing; and service on various education related boards and commissions.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"fedd6f6cb7740d794b2d2382578a4518","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Higher Education Resource Services (HERS) records reflect the development of a successful women’s organization.

He also increased the volume of sponsored research at the University.  He saw the University campus expand from 75 to 125 acres, and was responsible for many construction projects, including residence halls, a Law Center, and a science and engineering center.

Soon after, the fortunes of Central City declined while those of Denver, Colorado rose.  In 1881 the Opera House was rescued from demolition by the Gilpin County Opera House Association.  As the population of Central City declined, the House was allowed to deteriorate until a local businessman, Peter McFarlane, took it over, paid for repairs and supported it through several seasons of financial loss.  In 1910 moving pictures were shown, but it was not enough to save the theater, and in 1927, McFarlane closed the Opera House.</p><p>In 1931, Ida Kruse McFarlane, who was a professor of English at the University of Denver, decided to try to rescue the Opera House from destruction.  She enlisted the help of Anne Evans, daughter of the second territorial governor and a member of the University of Denver’s Civic Theater.  They first determined that the Opera House was structurally sound, and then approached the University of Denver with the possibility of the University accepting title to the Opera House.  The plan would take advantage of the tax-exempt status of the University and its connection to the Civic Theater.  The University agreed to accept the gift from the McFarlane family, but stipulated that the University would have no responsibility for the upkeep of the property or its use as a theater.  Those responsibilities fell to a group composed of Anne Evans, Ida Kruse McFarlane, Allen True, Edna James Chappell and Delos Chappell, who in 1931 formed the Central City Opera House Association.  </p><p>The Opera House was renovated, funds were raised, and on July 16, 1932, the first production was presented.  Opening ceremonies included Frederick McFarlane handing the Opera House key to Frederick M. Hunter, Chancellor of the University of Denver. The opening production was Camille and starred Lillian Gish.  Robert Edmond Jones designed and produced Camille along with several other early productions.  It was the beginning of a long run of summer opera seasons that grew to include Denver débutantes as flower girls.  Many important singers appeared in Central City productions, including Beverly Sills.  Central City Opera House Association commissioned five original operas:  The Ballad of Baby Doe, Gabriel’s Daughter:  The Story of Clara Brown, The Face on the Barroom Floor, Lady from Colorado and En Mis Palabras. </p><p>The Association held the Central City Play Festival from 1932-1942 and from 1946-1970.  Performances included the premieres of ''The Ballad of Baby Doe''(1956) and ''Lady From Colorado''(1964).  The Festival was suspended from 1942-1945. </p><p>The Central City Opera House Association’s affiliation to the University of Denver continued for many years.  In addition to the Opera House itself, the University owned many other properties in Central City that were donated to the University.  Other properties were donated to the Association directly.  In 1953 the Teller House was transferred from the University to the Association in order to relieve the University of building ownership in which liquor was sold.  At the same time, an agreement was completed between the two entities whereby the Association would manage all the properties on the University’s behalf.  That arrangement continued with minor modifications until 1982.  The Central City Opera House Association was in one of its periodic financial downturns and requested that the University transfer some of their properties to the Association so that they could be sold to fund the upkeep and renovation of other important properties.  An agreement was reached and the real estate holdings of the University of Denver that were located in Central City were transferred to the Association in 1982.  </p><p>The Association has continued to prosper and holds a summer opera season.

She graduated from high school at age 15 and studied at both the University of Denver and the University of Colorado before working for 14 years at the Rocky Mountain News. She received an honorary Doctorate of Literature from the University of Denver in 1947. She married a fellow reporter, Robert L. Chase, on June 7, 1928 and shortly thereafter was fired from her job as a result of a prank she played on her boss. She was reinstated but chose to leave to raise a family. She had three sons and lived in Denver at 532 W. Fourth Avenue, now an historic home. She died in 1981.</p><p>Inspiration for the play Harvey came from an encounter with an acquaintance during World War II. According to Chase, ''she was a woman who had worked for years to send her only son through college. The day I looked at her, her boy had been dead about two months, killed in action in the Pacific. I asked myself a question: Could I ever possibly write anything that might make that woman laugh again?'' One night Chase dreamed about a psychiatrist being chased by a giant white rabbit. Her four Irish uncles had told her stories of pookas, mischievous goblins or spectors held in Irish folklore to appear only to those who believe. The play took Chase two years to write, in the evenings when her children were in bed and her husband was at his job. She rewrote Harvey 50 times, trying it out on family, friends, and her cleaning lady before sending it to New York producer Brock Pemberton. He called her up a few nights later while she was reading a bedtime story to her boys to offer to produce the play. </p><p>Harvey opened on Broadway to rave reviews and played there for four and a half years, making it one of the five longest running Broadway plays. The success of her play did not go to Chase's head; the morning after the opening, she returned to her home in Denver, retrieved her children from friends, and began cleaning house and doing laundry. She had difficulty finishing her chores, however, because of the thousands of glowing phone calls and letters she received. Happily, her original question was answered when the woman whose son had died told her she had seen the play and had laughed. ''And strangely,'' wrote Chase, ''I got letters from many other parents from all over the country, people who had lost sons in the war. They all told me Harvey had brought them their first real laugh in months.''</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"cfa5328d06e0e8b4801dc0767dfc8778","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Mary Coyle Chase Papers contain a 1943 typewritten manuscript of the play, Harvey, with some changes made in pencil.

He attended Nebraska Wesleyan University for one year from 1904 to 1905.  He placed a hold on continuing his education by accepting a position with the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Adrian, Michigan from 1905 to 1907.  But he resumed his education at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln until his graduation with a Bachelor of Arts in 1911. He continued his work experience in education as a high school teacher and coach in Omaha. Upon graduation, Cherrington continued to graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley until 1917.  While there, he retained his relationship with the YMCA by acting as secretary for the state chapter.  In 1919 he served as the Executive Secretary of the Denver Student chapter of the YMCA.  On June 28, 1924 he married Edith Harper and raised two children, Anne Mary and Benjamin Mark, Jr.  Cherrington earned five academic degrees: an A.B. from the University of Nebraska in 1911, an A.M. from the University of California in 1922, a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1934, an L.L.D. from the University of Nebraska in 1934 and a Doctor of Public Service from the University of Denver in 1953.</p><p>During this time he also began his long term career with the University of Denver as an instructor in 1926.  He was named Director of the University of Denver Graduate School of International Studies, Chair of the Graduate School. In 1943 he was appointed acting chancellor of the University while Chancellor Caleb Gates was fulfilling his military duties in World War II. Cherrington served in that post until February 1946.   During his term of office as chancellor, he added the School of Speech, Department of Theatre, and the Hotel and Restaurant Management School to the University's programs. He taught at the University until 1951. Cherrington also founded the Social Science Foundation at the University and maintained his association with that organization until 1943. </p><p>His work in international relations began in 1938 when Cherrington accepted the task of organizing the work of the newly-created Division of Cultural Relations in the U.S. Department of State at the invitation of Secretary of State Cordell Hull and President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This work continued with the United Nations when he was involved with the U.N. San Francisco Convention in 1944.  In addition to his work in education, Cherrington was an author of the United Nations Charter and a co-founder of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He continued his work with the U.N. through UNESCO after World War II.  He worked at UNESCO for six years developing its commission and temporarily presiding as chair until Milton Eisenhower took over. Cherrington then became vice-chair.  His work in international relations and universal consciousness through education resumed with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, which provided colleges and universities opportunities to establish cultural relations and international affairs programs for their students and faculties.

His major goal was to create social change and world consciousness through education. The papers include general professional correspondence, administrative and official records, conference addresses, publications, images, recordings, lecture notes, course outlines and official memorabilia related to his work with the University of Denver, the YMCA, the Social Science Foundation, the League of Nations, the National Education Association, the US Department of State, Division of Cultural Relations, the UN, UNESCO, the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, Rotary International and the Rotary Club of Denver, as well as related to his personal life and education.  The National Student YMCA papers cover the years 1911 to 1926.  These papers cover national programs and Rocky Mountain regional programs during the time Cherrington served as secretary.  The collection also houses records related to Cherrington’s travel to Europe in 1921 and again in 1926 related to his coordination of seminars for government leaders.  The University of Denver series from 1926 to 1951 covers his work with the Graduate School of International Studies, his chairmanship of the Graduate School and the Social Science Foundation and his Chancellorship during World War II.  Courses which Cherrington taught at the University of Denver are arranged chronologically and contain course outlines and lecture notes. The collection also contains materials related to his work with the National Education Association from 1940 to 1946 and other education initiatives such as conferences and seminars. Cherrington’s papers surrounding his involvement with international affairs begin with the League of Nations from 1930 to 1938. These papers include correspondence, background materials and reports related to the New York, Chicago, and Colorado offices. Those papers related to the U.S. Department of State’s Division of Cultural Relations, the United Nations and UNESCO record his role in international affairs during and following World War II.  Dated from 1936 to 1951, these comprise the majority of the collection.

The college was incorporated in 1888 as Colorado Woman's College, though it did not open until 1909. Incorporated in 1888, the college did not open until 1909.  Located in northeast Denver, the college changed its name in 1967 to Temple Buell College, after Denver philanthropist and architect, Temple Buell, announced plans to endow the school with a $25 million gift. However, before the gift could be realized, debts increased and enrollment fell.

From 1887 to 1888, meetings were held and plans made for a women's college for the Western United States.  In April 1888, 20 acres of Montrose was designated for a ''female college of high order.''  A constitution was adopted October 22, 1888, which provided that the name would be ''The Colorado Woman’s College Society.''  The first Board of Trustees was elected in November 1888, comprised of 22 men and five women, and a Certificate of Incorporation for Colorado Woman’s College was presented to Arapahoe County, Colorado on November 14, 1888.</p><p>As in many such enterprises, the college was impeded by lack of financial support, and it was March 25, 1890 before the cornerstone for the Administration Building, later named Treat Hall, was laid.  Money problems continued to plague the founders of the college, and it was not until 1908 that a President, Jay Porter Treat, was elected.  The first students arrived in September 1909, and the first commencement was June 6, 1911.  </p><p>The school experienced periods of growth as well as financial setbacks in the early years.  In 1926 Samuel Jesse Vaughan was elected the fourth president of Colorado Woman’s College and the college began an aggressive fund-raising campaign to expand the college and add dormitory space.  Foote Hall, named after Ira A. Foote who until his death had been an ardent supporter of the college, was authorized in 1930.  During Dr. Vaughan’s tenure enrollment increased from 93 to 236.  The strict social code of the college was relaxed to allow a gala carnival, but not enough to allow smoking or dancing. The tradition of 'The Hanging of the Christmas Greens' began in 1930.  It received its accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission as Colorado Woman's College in 1932. College president Samuel Vaughan also began the library, which boasted 3,000 volumes in 1928 and 6,000 by 1933.  </p><p>The next president, James Edwin Hutchingson, served from 1933 until 1950.  He was well acquainted with the college, having been on the Board of Trustees since 1923.  The depression years were survived by creative measures such as exchanging tuition, housing and meals for farm produce or labor.  Although the depression affected the college’s fundraising adversely, the student body was steadily increasing until it reached 360 in the 1939-1940 academic year.  The completion of Porter Hall, an additional dormitory, was accomplished in 1939. </p><p>The post-World War II boom also hit the college.  Enrollment, which had been 397 in 1943 increased to 507 for the 1949-1950 year. The building required to support the increased student body was also undertaken, with a dormitory, Pulliam Hall, and Dora Porter Mason Hall, which housed the dining hall, gymnasium and swimming pool, were completed in 1947. By fall 1956, when Curtis Hall opened as a dormitory, enrollment was 531.  At the same time a new science building, Hutchingson Hall, was started.  Expansion continued with the addition of Whatley Chapel in 1962, and the Permelia Curtis Porter Library in 1963.  </p><p>The expansion also extended to academics.  In 1963 a program was established in Vienna, Austria to allow students to study abroad for a year.  A year later a program was established in Madrid, Spain and in 1966 one was started in Geneva, Switzerland.  The early 1960s also saw the construction of two additional dormitories, Dutton Hall and Dunklee Hall.  In 1965, Mrs. W. Ida Houston donated assets to help construct a fine arts center on the campus, which was named the W. Dale and W. Ida Houston Fine Arts Center.  </p><p>In 1966, the college was offered what seemed to be the answer to all its financial dreams.  Temple Buell, a Denver architect and philanthropist, offered to endow the college with a trust worth an estimated $25,000,000 in return for changing the name of the college to Temple Buell College.  The agreement did not provide any cash to the college, only income from the trust that could be used to pay off mortgages and other obligations.  Upon Buell’s death the trust money would become available to the college.  The trustees agreed and on July 1, 1967, Colorado Woman’s College became Temple Buell College.  </p><p>Another addition to the college was the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Edward O. Stoddard for a medical building.  With additional financial support from John Nelson Meade, the center broke ground in 1970 as the Loa M. Stoddard Student Health Center and John N. Meade Hospital and Medical Services.  </p><p>The tide of history was turning against women’s colleges, however, and enrollment began a steady decline after 1967, when it peaked at 1117.  The name change to Temple Buell College had caused many of the former donors to the college to assume that their contributions were no longer needed.  Also, the name change had not helped with recruitment.  Colorado Woman’s College was well known throughout the country.  Temple Buell College was not.  Finally financial reality forced the trustees to resolve to change the name of the college back to a form of its previous name, even if it meant giving up the Buell trust.  It was formally resolved March 29, 1973 that the college would be known as Colorado Women’s College (woman became plural and changed to women).  </p><p>The new name that was supposed to bring with it more community financial support, did not relieve the problems of the college.  Finances were desperate even with gifts from the Boettcher, Gates and El Pomar foundations.  In 1976 a proposal was made to make the college a component of the University of Denver, but was rejected by the trustees.  In an attempt to revitalize the college, a $7,000,000 fundraising campaign was initiated and Marjorie Bell Chambers was elected president on May 19, 1976.  Dropping enrollment, coupled with questions as to the financial viability of the college, caused major donors to discontinue support.  The decision was made not to reopen in January 1977.  That caused a flurry of action as alumnae and friends scrambled to raise funds.  By January 3, 1997, the day the school was to close, $500,000 in cash and pledges had been raised and the trustees were persuaded to keep the school open.  </p><p>New programs such as a re-engagement program intended to attract women who had interrupted their academic careers and were ready to resume their education in order to prosper in the corporate world.  There was also discord, as President Chambers left the college after only a year, and was replaced by Sherry Manning.  Manning began a program of weekend college that allowed women to obtain a bachelor's degree by going to school on weekends.  The first registration, in March 1980 enrolled 127 students.  It was not enough.  By the end of 1980 the college could not afford to continue operating.  The situation was exacerbated by a dispute with the faculty over raises and tenure.  Added to that was the threat that the North Central Association would withhold accreditation due to the financial situation.  So, on April 30, 1981, it was resolved that Colorado Women’s College and the University of Denver, a private university, would explore affiliation of the two institutions.  On November 22, 1981 the Board of Trustees accepted an offer from the University of Denver to acquire the assets of Colorado Women’s College.

He spent much of his early life in Troy, N.Y. and graduated from high school before enlisting in the Army in 1945.  Feldman served in the military for three years, spending much of his time in the service stationed in the Philippines.  Feldman achieved the rank of Second Lieutenant while serving as a Field Artillery Commander.  Feldman then attended Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. where he received his B.A. in 1949. Feldman received his M.A. in English from Columbia University in 1954.  While working on his master's degree at Columbia University, Burton married Margaret (Peggy) Mary Gildea in 1953. Feldman worked for a brief period in 1956 for United Productions of America. Feldman helped with writing episodes of Gerald McBoing Boing, and was also employed to conduct research on storylines in the public domain that could potentially be adopted into cartoons. Feldman then moved on to the University of Chicago to both teach and work on his Ph.D., which he received in 1965.</p><p>Feldman was a lecturer in both literature and philosophy at the University of Chicago from 1957 - 1962.  During his time in Chicago, Feldman studied under Leo Strauss, a political philosophy professor, and became friends with Mircea Eliade, a Romanian author and scholar of religion.  After leaving the University of Chicago, Feldman and his wife spent two years in Europe and Turkey teaching for the University of Maryland. After returning to the U.S., Feldman arrived at the University of Denver in 1965. During his time at the University, Feldman acted as Director of Undergraduate Honors in English (1968 - 1974), Editor of the Denver Quarterly (1970 - 1975), and Director of Graduate Studies in English (1980 - 1984).  While teaching at the University of Denver, Feldman undertook his professional scholarship in earnest. Working with Professor Robert D. Richardson, Jr., Feldman published ''The Rise of Modern Mythology: 1680 - 1860'' in 1972. The book explored the use of myth in the western world and how it was used in literature and society from 1680-1860. Richardson and Feldman continued to work together from 1979 - 1984, and published a 50 volume compendium of rare and important mythological texts used by Romantic poets. The anthology is entitled ''Myth and Romanticism.''  In 2000, Feldman published a history of the Nobel Prizes entitled ''The Nobel Prize: A History of Genius, Controversy, and Prestige.'' The book is a comprehensive study of the Prizes themselves, the process behind their awarding, and what each one has represented socially throughout its existence.  Feldman worked on several scholarly projects that never saw publication.  A book tentatively entitled ''Fame and Glory'' explored the idea of notoriety and the seeking of recognition in literary figures, both authors and characters. Feldman also wanted to write a sequel to ''The Rise of Modern Mythology: 1680 - 1860'' that would update it to modern day, but the project was never completed or published.  Feldman was also a poet, amateur novelist, and an artist. Feldman had his poetry published in a number of different journals over the course of his life. Feldman made efforts to publish a book of poetry, but was unsuccessful.  Feldman was also unsuccessful in getting any of his several novels published. Feldman never made any professional attempts at drawing, but maintained it as a hobby throughout his life.  Feldman maintained friendships with many literary figures. Both Feldman and his wife regularly corresponded with both Rikki Ducornet and David Markson, two modernist authors.The Feldmans also kept in close contact with Mircea Eliade and his wife Christinel. Burton Feldman also struck up a friendship and corresponded for a time with Roald Hoffman, the winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.  Feldman retired from the University of Denver in 1998 and died from cancer in Denver, Colorado on January 10, 2003. At the time of his death, Burton Feldman had been working on a book that was part fact and part historical fiction that chronicled the friendship of Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, Bertrand Russell, and Kurt Godel in their declining years.  Feldman had tentatively entitled the work ''Einstein and Friends.''  The book was finished and published in 2007 under the supervision of Peggy Feldman and Katherine Williams with the title ''112 Mercer St.: Einstein, Russell, Godel, Pauli, and the End of Innocence in Science.''</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"9ba52da7b6b932a72f19cd52407cdb1a","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"This collection contains photographs, drawings and scrapbooks, correspondence, research notes and supporting documentation, both published and unpublished manuscripts and drafts, 5.25 inch and 3.5 inch floppy disks, newspaper clippings, address books, journals, and printed ephemera.

By 1869, he was teaching school in Bowne, Michigan. In 1873, he moved to Buffalo, New York where he worked as a court reporter. Eventually, he split his time between Buffalo and Fort Wayne, Indiana where he met and married Louise Lytle. The two lived in the boarding house that Louise Lytle’s mother owned. Together they had three children, Irene, Lawrence, and Roland. Lawrence died the day of his birth. In 1880, Arthur decided that Denver, Colorado would be a good up-and-coming place to establish himself and raise his family. So he moved himself and, a few months later, his family. Unfortunately, Louise Miller died when the children were still babies. Nevertheless, Arthur Miller quickly built up a thriving real estate business and became a leader in Denver. Around 1900, he married Emma Combs, a member of the Round Table Literary Club and the Colorado Chapter of The Daughters of the American Revolution. Together they had two children, Victor and Marcella. Arthur Miller was a member of the Royal Arcanum.</p><p>Marcella Miller duPont, born September 9, 1903, was the daughter of Emma Combs Miller and Arthur Scott Miller. She attended Wolcott School in Denver and Smith College in Northhampton, Massachusetts. She married Alfred Victor duPont in 1924. They lived for many years in Wilmington, Delaware and were divorced in 1948. Her poetry, published in Sonnets and Lyrics in 1950 and Poems: Folio Two in 1956, reflects the influence of Edna St. Vincent Milay and Emily Dickinson. </p><p>Marcella Miller duPont attended Wolcott School for Girls from which she graduated in 1920. In a letter to Jane Gould of the University of Denver, Marcella duPont reminisced about her youth in New York: ''Your mentioning Frank Case reminded me of pre-War New York days when his daughter, Maggie Harriman, introduced me to her group, which included Lillian Hellman, Dorothy Parker, and a number of male New Yorker writers. As you can imagine, with these people there were conversational fireworks all the time that, by rights, should have touched off a major conflagration in the heart of New York City'' (from a letter to Jane Gould dated January 23, 1968). </p><p>In 1966, Marcella duPont wrote to the University of Denver about endowing a study room in the library to house her papers and her brother’s collection: ''In other words, what I visualize is a room where students or scholars could work in pleasant, comfortable surroundings…'' (from letter of June 8, 1966). On May 26, 1967, the room was dedicated in honor of her parents who, she said, ''contributed to what Denver is today and to what Colorado is today'' (May 26, 1967 at the dedication of the room). In numerous letters to University faculty, Marcella's enthusiastic devotion was always conspicuous. As she once wrote, ''remember that when I am far away, I am always thinking … of the Room'' (from a letter of June 22, 1967). </p><p>Marcella Miller duPont died September 17, 1985. </p><p>Victor A. Miller was born October 12, 1898 in Denver, Colorado to Emma and Arthur Miller. He was educated in Denver Public Schools and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale in 1919, though he took off a year to serve as a second lieutenant in World War II. He received his law degree from the University of Denver Law School in 1922 and was a longtime member of the American, Colorado, and Denver Bar Associations. In 1920, he married Helen Ludlow Bingham of Denver. Together they had three daughters, Caroline, Victoria, and Marcella. He married again on September 25, 1937 to Beatrice Anita Andrews. He opened a private law practice in 1922 and was successful to the point of being nominated Colorado Attorney General in 1930, a position which he did not accept. He and his half-brother Roland ran Miller Estates, founded by their father Arthur S. Miller. He was a receiver for the Rio Grande Southern Railroad from 1929 to 1938 and directed Kesto Corporation and other organizations. He pioneered light motor rail transportation and developed policies for maintaining narrow gauge lines in Colorado. A member of the Colorado Yale Association, he was also active in the American Legion and became Commander-Elect in 1928. He was also the founder and author of ''Reveille,'' a publication for the American Legion community.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"58dac8a796607abc81b779f5b3204c3b","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Miller and duPont Families Papers contains the materials of Arthur Miller and his children Victor A.

Victor Miller had a life long interest in the Civil War. At his death, his substantial library of books, letters, and other Civil War-related items was donated to the University of Denver.

Arthur Miller’s diaries and rent books, the majority of which are written in shorthand, cover the years 1866 to 1912. These were saved by his son Roland and eventually were donated to the University of Denver by Arthur Miller and Marcella Miller duPont. The diaries begin when Arthur Miller was attending school in Michigan and continue as he taught school, traveled to New York to be a court reporter, lived in Fort Wayne, Indiana where he met and married his first wife, moved to Denver, and became a successful businessman. The collection includes the transcripts of the diaries from 1880 and 1881. Of particular interest in these years are Arthur Miller’s descriptions of his relationship with his wife and child as well as his opinion of the court cases he was handling and the events surrounding those cases.     Marcella Miller duPont’s papers take up the chronology in 1932 with the first copies of letters from H.L. Mencken to Mrs. duPont. These letters marked the beginning of a decade and a half of correspondence. The collection also includes a nature journal created by M.M. duPont, Genevieve Kassler Brock, and Mary Frances Spaulding Brock when they were young. The most recent material includes a variety of personal papers relating to Marcella duPont’s social life including her summers spent in the East. This collection was at one time housed in the Marcella Miller duPont room in the Mary Reed Library at the University of Denver."}],"type":"scopecontent","persistent_id":"0a2ce82163d4325711f59e576a9bd373","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The collection is arranged in three series:; 1.

The meetings began at 8:00 and sometimes ran past 10:00 in the evening, so the reviews were quite detailed.  The minutes contain a condensation of the reviews and contain interesting insights into the opinions of the members.

After her retirement in 1970 she enjoyed photography and rock collecting.  A careful investor, she accumulated an estate of almost $9, most of which she bequeathed to the University of Denver.</p><p>Virginia E. Trevorrow was born in 1909 to Edwin and Zepha Trevorrow, and was raised in Independence, Colorado, where her father was a superintendent of a gold mining venture.

The loss of the mining economy, coupled with her father's death, caused Virginia's mother to move to Denver where Virginia attended West High School.  </p><p>Virginia received her bachelors degree from the University of Denver and went on to receive a masters from Universtiy of Colorado.  At that point she began working as a research biochemist at the Child Research Council, a facility funded through the University of Colorado Medical Center.

The two lived frugally, and invested their extra income in stocks and bonds.  After she retired, Virginia and Vera built a model railroad in their basement.  Virginia also became interested in photography and indulged in rock collecting.  The two women traveled around the world and Virginia collected rock specimens from the countries she visited.  </p><p>Virginia and Vera enjoyed attending concerts at the Lamont School of Music, and Virginia remained interested in her alma mater.

She was the first child of Ora Lee and Nell Nicholson Capps.  Loraine and her younger brother, Larry, were raised in Northwest Denver. Loraine attended Skinner Junior High and graduated from North High School in 1938.  She was one of the students who attended the University of Denver while living at home, traveling to her classes by the trolley cars that earned DU the nickname “Tramway Tech.”  She graduated from DU in 1942 and began teaching in Denver Public Schools.</p><p>During her college years, she met Dale W. Kehl.  Dale had left home early in his life and was taking classes as well as working.  They were married on May 3, 1943 in Walla Walla, Washington, where Dale was stationed with the Army Air Corps for flight training. The couple spent most of the war in Florida, where their son, Dale, Jr. was born in 1945.  After the war they returned to Denver, and Dale opened a printing business.  In 1947, another son, Gary, was born.  </p><p>The Kehls lived a life similar to many in the post-war era.  He ran a successful business; she stayed home to raise their sons.  They were both active in the Shrine and Masonic organizations, he serving as Potentate and she as Queen of Daughters of the Nile.  They were active in their son’s schools and took part in other civic activities through the Rotary Club and other organizations.  Through their activities and long residence in Jefferson County, they acquired a large circle of friends and entertained often.</p><p>After Gary left home for college, Loraine went back to school and earned her Masters of Education from the University of Colorado.  She then went on to teach, mostly second grade, in Jefferson County until 1982 when she retired.  Dale had retired before that, selling out of the printing business when he saw copy machines and computers as the way of the future.  He then devoted his time to investing and real estate.</p><p>After Loraine retired, she and Dale traveled the world, circling the globe.  They loved traveling and took many photographs of their journeys, as well as informational material. They visited the Holy Lands and Egypt, taking Loraine’s mother along.  One of their highlights was a trip to China in 1988.  </p><p>They loved being with family.  They added a swimming pool to their home on Green Mountain, which was a favorite meeting place as Dale, Jr. had children and their good friends Tom and June Hammond had grandchildren about the same ages. After her mother died, Loraine volunteered at Lutheran Medical Center, as well as remaining active in Daughters of the Nile.  As they got older they began spending the winter months in Mesa, Arizona, finally buying a unit at Leisure World.  By the late 1990s, Dale’s health began to fail as he battled emphysema.  Dale died in 2000.  Their son, Gary, died of lung cancer two years later, a severe blow to Loraine.  But she continued to be active with her activities, tap dancing and exercising, until a broken pelvis curtailed her.  She died May 28, 2008.</p><p>Loraine’s family had a long association with Colorado and she became the keeper of the family information.     Her father grew up in Missouri and was a schoolteacher and superintendent in Missouri and Oklahoma before World War I.  In the War he served in France, where he was awarded a Purple Heart and the Silver Star for gallantry.  After the war he received his law degree from the University of Denver in 1925.  He was an attorney for the Veterans Administration in Denver until his retirement in 1958.  He was active in the Shrine and Veterans organizations.  </p><p>Loraine’s mother, Nell Nicholson Capps, was born May 5, 1893 to a Denver pioneer family.  Her mother’s ancestors with names of Larrick and Nicholson are among the old graves in Crown Hill Cemetery in Wheat Ridge. Nell attended Montclair Elementary School and graduated from Arvada High School.  She was a graduate of State Teachers College in Greeley.  She taught music in the public schools as well as teaching piano and organ privately.  Like her husband and Loraine and Dale, she was active in the Shrine, Daughters of the American Revolution and other civic groups.</p><p>The Daughters of the American Revolution started the family interest in genealogy.  Nell’s sister, Bessie Pearl Nicholson, did extensive research on the family.  Pearl, as she was known to the family, received degrees from both Colorado Woman’s College in Denver and Colorado State Teachers College in Greeley.  She taught her entire career, most of which was spent in California.  She was very active in the DAR and upon her death her genealogical research material was left to her sister, Nell, and then to Loraine.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"beb82c3b0486978c9d3254672bdc2e4f","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Loraine Capps Kehl Family Papers cover mainly three generations will connections to the University of Denver.

Gates, Chancellor of the University of Denver, sent a memorandum to the Board of Trustees, recommending that a School of Architecture and Planning be established in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Denver, to be located on the Civic Center Campus. Provisions for additional drafting space were made in Rodney Curtis Hall, in the Monroe Hotel located at 230 15th Street, Denver, Colorado, and in the workshop of Clayton Plumbing Company.  </p><p>The justification advanced for the establishment of such a school was the lack of any school of architecture between Lincoln, Nebraska and the West Coast. Further, such a school at the University of Denver could draw upon its existing faculty. </p><p>The Faculty of Arts and Sciences would be combined with the School of Business Administration and the School of Engineering to serve in this capacity. Accrediting requirements were explored in some detail in 1951, but the decision for accreditation was postponed for one year. A Bachelor's Degree in Architecture and Planning in the College of Arts and Sciences was proposed. The 1947 to 1950 brochures outlined a 5-year basic curriculum. After two years of operation, the director submitted a revision for the last three years of the training program and submitted it to Dean James E. Perdue on January 30, 1948. The revision was a rearrangement of the sequence of courses. Relationships of additional curricular studies in other areas of the University were stipulated for Engineering, Business Administration and Law, Arts and Sciences and the Library.</p><p>The Director of the School was Professor Carl Feiss and Leonard Currie was temporarily designated as Assistant to the Director and Assistant Professor. Joseph Shelley was designated as instructor. The 1949 correspondence names Carl Feiss as Director. In the 1950 Report, Professor Vance Kirkland is listed as Director (administration only). Others listed are: Eugene Steinberg, Associate Professor; Howard Miller, Assistant Professor; and Victor Horbein, Instructor. </p><p>A Professional Advisory Committee of eight men was appointed. The initial recommendation to the Board of Trustees outlined a tentative basic curriculum of three quarters and a recommended budget. Members of the Advisory Committee consisted of practicing architects, planners and the builders. They were: Paul Atchison, Alan Fisher, Burnham Hoyt, Irvin McCrary, G. Meredith Musick, Thomas Moore, Earl Morris and Lyle Webber. </p><p>The graduation of June 10, 1952 had 16 students who had been cleared for the Bachelor of Arts degree, with a major in Architecture. Seven students were granted a Bachelor of Architecture and Planning. </p><p>The December 17, 1951 report by J. M. Shelley states that the basic aims of the school had still not been accomplished. He believed that outside subsidy was justified; that private practice by members should be approved; and he emphasized the need for a full-time permanent Director. </p><p>In 1952, the School of Architecture and Planning at the University of Denver was discontinued, the probable cause being competition from the newly established School of Architecture in the College of Engineering at the University of Colorado.

In the fall of 1888 the first classes were held in the Haish Building at 14th and Arapahoe Street.</p><p>The first course was five months in length, with the first class graduating in 1889. That course schedule was increased to three seven-month semesters in 1891, when the School became a member of the National Association of Dental Faculties. The entrance requirements were also strengthened to require a high school diploma or a first class teacher's certificate. To provide training for students the school advertised in local newspapers, offering dental work for cost from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. </p><p>In 1896 the School of Dentistry took over the entire first floor of the Haish Building. At the same time a formal agreement was reached to divide the profits between the faculty of the School and the Trustees of the University of Denver. The University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, also attempted to start a dental school in the 1890s, locating it in Denver. The University of Denver protested its location in Denver, as opposed to Boulder, so the Colorado College of Dental Surgery was created by five individual dentists. </p><p>By the turn of the century, it was apparent that there was no need for two dental colleges, and on March 8, 1901 the Trustees of the University of Denver agreed to merge the two schools. The resulting Colorado College of Dental Surgery was considered to be the Dental Department of the University of Denver. Dr. L. S. Gilbert was the first Dean, but resigned in May 1901. His successor was Dr. W. T. Chambers, who served as Dean until 1914. The arrangement was similar to the old dental school in that the School was actually owned by the faculty members through a contract with the University of Denver. </p><p>In 1904 the three-year course was extended to four years, but was returned to three years in 1906 to retain students who wanted a shorter course of study. The college moved into new quarters in 1911, and added additional space in 1914. At that time the college introduced an eight-month course to train dental nurses, which was the first such program in the United States . By 1917 the program was again extended to four years, and in 1926 a five-year degree program was instituted. That remained the standard until the school closed in 1932. </p><p>Pressure was building in the medical and dental communities nation-wide to have more stringent controls over the training of medical and dental professionals. Proprietary schools, schools owned by practitioners, in particular were criticized. In 1918 the first ranking of dental school in the United States placed Colorado College of Dental Surgery in Class B. One of the ways to overcome the ratings and perceived shortcomings was to affiliate with the University. While the school had been tenuously associated with the University of Denver, on June 15, 1922, the University agreed to assume full responsibility for the school. The school, which had been profitable under the proprietors, was not a financial success since the University needed to expend considerable funds in an attempt to bring the school up to Class A ranking. An attempt was made to transfer the Dental Department to the University of Colorado in affiliation with the medical school. The stock collapse of 1929 and ensuing depression complicated that plan because the University of Colorado would not accept the school without the finances to be self-supporting. All attempts to finance the School of Dentistry through the State failed. The school continued until June 8, 1932, to allow students to complete their course work. During its existence, the Colorado College of Dental Surgery had graduated more than 1,000 dentists with accredited degrees.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"edb5c386aeeda0c9b9ed8495373cb6c3","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The records of the School of Dentistry at the University of Denver consist of legal documents, minutes and school history, as well as newspaper clippings and alumni information."}],"type":"scopecontent","persistent_id":"70172b36dad3638c9b8a380c4c771069","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"This collection is arranged in one series:; 1.

In 1877, another group of Denver doctors, recent colleagues and friendly competitors of the Denver school, started the Gross Medical College. Yet, in 1903, the two medical schools merged and as part of the agreement, the Colorado Seminary, the University of Denver's charter institution, agreed to provide facilities for the Denver and Gross College of Medicine in the Haish Building, located at 14th and Arapahoe Streets, Denver. In 1907, a new building was constructed for the Medical College for use as a dispensary and clinic. However, following review from the the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association and Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching researched by Abraham Flexnor the school fell under scrutiny for substandard medical care. Flexner's Report called for a reorganization of medical education and recommended that The Denver and Gross College consolidate with the University of Colorado School so as to improve conditions and minimize duplicative resources.  Following heated debates, the executive board of the Denver and Gross College of Medicine demanded that the trustees of the University of Denver either grant finances appropriate to sustain a modern top class institution or approve the transfer of the program to the University of Colorado. An agreement was reached and the consolidation was effective in 1912.

In a University press release its purpose was stated to be “to conduct research requested by local industries who have no research facilities available within their own organizations.  Through the utilization of the Bureau’s services, it is expected that industry of the Rocky Mountain area will be aided in developing raw materials and uses for by-products, as well as in producing new and improved products.”  The idea of educational institutions partnering with private industry to solve logistical and production problems came out of such partnerships developed during the Second World War. </p><p>The initial director of the bureau was Dr. Ralph M. Conrad.  His PhD was in Chemistry, and during the war he had worked with the Committee on Food Research to develop dried products, especially egg products, to supply the troops.  Dr. Conrad’s contacts within government and industry were important factors in the founding of DRI.  Tragically Dr. Conrad was killed in a river rafting accident in 1948, but the Bureau continued.  While the press release called the research facility the Bureau of Industrial Research, and it was listed as such in the University Bulletins, annual reports to the University Chancellor were made in the name of the Institute for Industrial Research.  Then on November 24, 1952, the name was officially changed by a resolution of the University Board of Trustees to Denver Research Institute.</p><p>In the 1950-1951 annual report, the Institute reported 20 projects.  By the 1952-53 report, there were 69 projects, 34 for industry and 35 for the Defense effort.  Seventy-nine industrial sponsors were listed for that year, and 16 federal agency sponsors.  Research was conducted in five areas: Chemistry, Electronics, Mechanics, Metallurgy, and Physics.</p><p>By 1965-66 an academic element had been added to the research.  Thirty research staff members taught a total of 179 credit hours in Arts and Sciences and 161 in College of Engineering.  Subjects varied from metallurgy and mechanics to industrial economy and electronics.  Grants to DRI totaled $6,588,940 covering  over 300 contracts.  During the 1970s DRI had a Center for Social Research and Development that studied social policy issues and human service delivery systems.   </p><p> DRI continued to grow, and add divisions:  Mathematical Sciences and Industrial Economics.  Industrial Economics included such areas as market research, recreation and tourism evaluations, urban analysis, and motivational research in addition to more traditional areas such as energy resources policies and forecasts and environmental problems.  Under the division of Industrial Product and Process Development research was conducted on Energy Sources & Technologies (biomass, alternative fuels, oil shale, electric vehicles),  Materials processing (explosive metals, armor and anti-armor technology, ceramics), Composites and Non-Metallic Materials (graphite-aluminum composites, Kevlar bulletproof fabrics), Minerals and Materials Extraction and processing (ores, trace metals from oil shale, economic feasibility studies).</p><p>The division of Economics and Management also broke new ground with research in Regional Economics and Growth Management (water economics and policy, hazardous waste economics and policy, resource management, reuse and recycling), business planning and management (marketing studies, financial planning, telecommunications economics and policy, real estate feasibility analysis, public opinion and attitude research), technology management (R&D management, transfer systems design, implementation and management, innovation, regulation and productivity) </p><p>DRI published the reports of these various research efforts, and these reports are often important research tools as science moves forward.  DRI’s focus and projects have depended on the priorities of the parties providing funding, including the federal government.  The projects in the 21st century differ from those of the mid-twentieth century, but the research facilities continue to function.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"a2fb86a3073f574b58fe50cf53f7671d","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The records of the Denver Research Institute (DRI) include annual reports and other departmental information.

These were the Carnegie Library (1908-1932), Mary Reed Library (1932-1972) and the current Penrose Library (1972-present).</p><p>The Carnegie Library was the first separate library structure built on the University of Denver University Park campus. It was built more than forty years after DU was founded in 1864. Just after the turn of the 20th century the University needed a library capable of meeting its rapidly-growing information needs. In 1906 the famous steel magnate Andrew Carnegie agreed to donate $30,000 toward a library if the school could raise matching funds. The University met the challenge and by 1908 had a new library. The building was just the third constructed at the University Park campus. Having already designed the first two, University Hall and Chamberlin Observatory, Robert Roeschlaub assumed the role of designing the campus library. Not surprisingly the structure employed the standard Carnegie Classical aesthetic. It was the last of 108 libraries that Carnegie funded personally. The 9,600 square foot one-story library included a basement and main floor.</p><p>   What is now called the Mary Reed Building was constructed as the Mary Reed Library in 1932. A stone inscription on the front (east side) of the structure still reads “Mary Reed Library” though it has not served that function for almost forty years. The Carnegie Library which it replaced was barely 20 years old but already incapable of meeting the University’s growing need for library resources. To find the resources needed for the ambitious project the University turned to its most magnanimous benefactress, Mary Reed, who was known as “Denver’s Lady Bountiful.” Having already donated the impressive sum of $200,000 for the construction of the Margery Reed Hall in honor of her daughter, Mary Reed provided an additional $500,000 for the library project and a related endowment A portrait of Mary Reed now hangs in the DuPont Room in Mary Reed to commemorate her generosity.</p><p> </p><p>   Noted Denver architect Harry J. Manning led the Mary Reed Library design team. The University had decided that it wanted to maintain the same Collegiate Gothic aesthetic that had shaped Margery Reed Hall as they developed the new library. As a result the design team used similar building materials, including rose-colored bricks and Indiana limestone. A crucial decision was the placement of the library. Although some wanted to maintain the open view of the front range to the west between University Hall and the Iliff School of Theology, the University ultimately chose to follow the Jeffersonian model from the University of Virginia: place the library at the highest and most prominent site on campus.  Another feature of the building was its floor plan: an “H” shape allowed natural light to fill the building during the day. The new building provided the University with all of the facilities needed for its central library: space for 400,000 volumes, “spacious reading rooms, customized furniture designed by the building’s architect, numerous exhibit rooms for archaeology and art displays, mullioned bay windows, wrought-iron railings with aluminum caps, exhibit cases, and a distinctive clustering of cathedral lights.” The building was dedicated over three days during the fall of 1932.</p><p>   The Mary Reed Library would serve as the main campus library for 40 years. By the 1960s however it was already clear that the university needed an even larger library. When Penrose Library was constructed in 1972 as the successor to Mary Reed the University found that Mary Reed was easily adaptable to other uses. Today the building houses many administrative offices such as the Chancellor’s office, Provost’s office, and Human Resources. Efforts to modify the building have been minimal, and the marble floors, Renaissance-style woodwork and Gothic-style windows remain. Recently the University demonstrated its commitment to the future of the building by funding an extensive tuck-pointing project that will replace much of the mortar on the structure </p><p>Penrose Library is the current main library at the University. Completed in 1972 as the successor to Mary Reed Library, it broke with all previous architectural styles on the DU campus. By the time the unique looking library opened in 1972, the University desperately needed the additional space for its growing book collections. The El Pomar Foundation provided the necessary funds for the building’s construction, and the library was named after Spencer Penrose, the man who had started the foundation with his wife in 1937. Penrose made his fortune by investing in Colorado mining at the turn of the 20th century and the El Pomar Foundation was an effort to give back to Colorado. Not only was the $4.5 million gift the largest in the history of the El Pomar Foundation at that time but it was also the largest single gift that the University had ever received from a foundation. The simple square layout guaranteed ease of use for the library’s visitors. Beyond that Penrose Library was quite different. The main colors on the inside of the building were bright yellow, bright orange, bright red and not-so-bright purple. The seats were unique as well: doughnut chairs, pod chairs and even carpeted formations upon which one could climb.</p><p>   Penrose Library has changed greatly over the past 35 years to meet the changing needs of students. In the 1980s, the University replaced the old card catalogue with a new computer catalogue. Subtler colors have taken the place of the old vivid warm hues, although they do still remain in some places. Many of the older chairs have been replaced by more functional counterparts. Several outside services have found a home at Penrose Library as well: the Quick Copy Center, the Center for Teaching and Learning, the University Technology Services Help Center, multiple computer labs, and even a new coffee station. Wireless internet access is also available throughout the building. Today, the library’s collection contains well over a million books. Considering all that it offers, Penrose Library fulfills its mission of enabling “the members of the University community to use information resources creatively, analytically and critically toward the acquisition of knowledge.”</p><p></p><p>   Penrose Library will probably remain the main library at the University for decades to come. Although the building will undergo extensive redesign work in the near future it will surely maintain the spirit of service to the university community that it has displayed for the past 35 years.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"e6737acec991091393065991e1246975","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"Somehow two collection #'s were associated with DU Libraries.

Students at the University of Denver attempted to form a chapter in 1906, but lacked sufficient funds. In the winter of 1907-1908 the Grand President of Sigma Kappa, Sara B. Mathews, visited Denver and recommended that the charter be granted. </p><p>Financial struggles of the organization and health problems of the members limited the growth of the Chapter in its early years. However, five years after the Chapter was founded, it gained enough strength to host the 39th Convention of the Sigma Kappa Sorority. The convention was successful, with Iota Chapter offering sorority sisters Western hospitality, fun and community.</p><p>The Chapter was involved in a variety of philanthropic activities. Its primary beneficiary was the Maine Sea Coast Mission, and in later years the Chapter also helped Alzheimer's patients. The Chapter members were involved in many University activities, and strove to maintain high academic standards.</p><p>In the 1930s, the Iota Chapter acquired a house for its members. The Sigma Kappa House at 2258 S. Josephine was constructed in 1932. It was purchased by the University in 1960 and renamed for Mrs. Rollie Bradford, a Sigma Kappa alumna and member of the University of Denver Board of Trustees. </p><p>The Iota Chapter had 35 members in 1966, and encountered financial difficulties. The National Council of Sigma Kappa decided to close the Chapter in October 1967, although they left open the possibility of reinstating the Chapter in the future. It was not until 1988, however, that enough interest was generated to reorganize the Chapter. At that time the University invited Sigma Kappa to reopen their Iota Chapter. In 1993, the Chapter was again experiencing financial problems as they graduated their largest class ever. Members began sacrificing class commitments to keep the Chapter open, and it was decided to close the Chapter. On May 14, 1993, the members of Iota Chapter voted to release the National Charter it had received when it reopened five years before.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"ccda3ce1e86c2d0fde264cf8625fa7e1","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The majority of the collection pertains to the most recent incarnation of the Iota Chapter, from 1988 to 1993.

The Senate is responsible for setting faculty personnel policies, including salary guidelines, sabbatical leave, faculty review and tenure.</p><p>When the Faculty Senate was formed, it consisted of all faculty members of full professional rank, all members of the Board of Trustees and administrative officers of the University. Members felt that they were not adequately consulted in matters of salary and budget decisions and the Senate was formed in part to rectify the situation. The Faculty Senate has responsibility for setting faculty personnel policies, including salary guidelines, sabbatical leave, faculty review and tenure. The Honors Committee of the Senate awards the Distinguished Teacher Award and the University Lecturer for each year, as well as honorary degrees. The Senate was instrumental in the creation of the Core Curriculum, development of policies regarding domestic partner benefits, and was involved in the decision to become a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I school. Over the years the Senate has also been involved in situations affecting the entire University. For example, the ad-hoc Committee on Student Unrest was formed in 1969 to address the student concerns that led to the “Woodstock West” action in 1970.  The composition of the Faculty Senate has changed over the years. In 1947, the Senate consisted of the chancellor, six trustees, including the president of the board, 12 administrators, 15 full professors, 11 associate professors, ten assistant professors, nine instructors, and three part-time faculty, a total of 67 members. The Chancellor was the ex-officio President of the Senate. The Vice President and the Secretary were elected annually, one of which was to be a trustee and the other a faculty member. The standing committees of the Senate included committees on budget, academic policy, personnel, honorary degrees, and nominations.  In 1952 the Senate Constitution was amended again. The composition of the body now included the chancellor, 12 other administrators, and 48 full-time faculty of all tenured ranks. The Chancellor no longer served as president of the Senate. Six ex-officio members of the Board of Trustees were included and obtained floor privileges but no voting rights. The President, Vice President and Secretary were elected annually by the Senate membership. An Executive Committee was added to the standing committees. It consisted of the President, Vice President, Secretary, and the chairs of the other standing committees. A Committee on Instruction and Curriculum and a Research Committee were added, presumably to replace the Academic Policy Committee, which was dropped. A Committee on Student Life was also added.  In 1955 the Board of Trustees membership was eliminated from the Faculty Senate. A Financial Planning Committee was added in 1967. By 1971 the membership of the Senate was expanded to include representatives from the Denver Research Institute and the Library. The Constitution was amended again in 1974, when representatives from the undergraduate and graduate student body were added. A number of standing committees were also added or changed in 1974. The Committee on Student Life became the Committee on Student Affairs, and committees on Computer Policy, Faculty Review, Library Policy, and Sabbatical Leave were added. In 1976 the Bookstore Policy Committee was added. Representatives from the Department of Athletics were added in 1984.  In 1986 the standing committees were reorganized once again. The committees on Instruction and Curriculum and Research were folded into an Academic Planning Committee. This committee was also charged with computer planning and library policies. The duties of the Faculty Review Committee and the Sabbatical Leave Committee were assigned to the Personnel Committee. Bookstore management and policy was assigned to the Committee on Student and Alumni Affairs.  During the 1980's the administration's representation to the Senate was decreased. In 1986 only the Vice-Chancellors for Academic Affairs and Research were given membership in the Senate. The standing committees continued to work with the administration in their respective areas of concern. As of the fall of 2002, the Senate membership consisted of approximately 50 members representing all the academic units.</p>"}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"4881546a61fabb76afdc02610baa6e23","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","subnotes":[{"publish":true,"jsonmodel_type":"note_text","content":"The Faculty Senate records consist of working documents and administrative materials of the organization from its inception in 1932 through 1999.
