Settlements are defined as all places or areas, however large, occupied or modified by human populations and with enough societal functions to be relatively self-sufficient. Also included in this hierarchy are descriptors for major types of natural landscape and cultural landscape and their components that provide the largest environmental context for built works. By placing natural landscapes in this hierarchy, the AAT has chosen not to emphasize a distinction between the natural environment and the built environment. Maintaining such a distinction is often frustrated because (a) there is continuity between the two, (b) much of the natural environment has been subject to human intervention and has the qualifies of a cultural artifact, and (c) much of the built environment, at a wide range of scale, functions as an ecological system.Relation to Other Hierarchies: Administrative bodies (e.g.g., \"nations\", \"provinces\") are located in the Organizations hierarchy. Adjectival attributes of some settlements (e.g., \"radial plan\") are found in the Associated Concepts hierarchy. Descriptors referring to individual plants and trees are found in the Materials hierarchy (e.g.g., \"bamboo\", \"pine\"), while descriptors for general vegetation (e.g., \"jungles\", \"shrubs\") are found here. Descriptors for infrastructural systems, networks of buildings, other structures, and equipment that constitute physically ordered entities within settlements and landscapes (e.g., \"bus transit systems\") are located in the Object Groupings and Systems hierarchy.","created_by":"admin","last_modified_by":"admin","create_time":"2014-08-18T15:50:46Z","system_mtime":"2014-08-18T15:50:46Z","user_mtime":"2014-08-18T15:50:46Z","source":"aat","jsonmodel_type":"subject","external_ids":[],"publish":true,"terms":[{"lock_version":0,"term":"Settlements and landscapes","created_by":"admin","last_modified_by":"admin","create_time":"2014-08-18T15:50:46Z","system_mtime":"2014-08-18T15:50:46Z","user_mtime":"2014-08-18T15:50:46Z","term_type":"genre_form","jsonmodel_type":"term","uri":"/terms/2495","vocabulary":"/vocabularies/1"}],"external_documents":[],"uri":"/subjects/2537","is_linked_to_published_record":false,"vocabulary":"/vocabularies/1"}

Small objects are typically referred to as \"carvings\" or another appropriate term. \"Sculpture\" refers to works that represent tangible beings, objects, or groups of objects, or are abstract works that have defined edges and boundaries and can be measured.

The picture was directed by Sam Wood. The film, which was Ronald Reagan's most notable role during his early acting career at Warner Brothers, was adapted by Casey Robinson from a best-selling 1940 novel of the same name by Henry Bellamann. The movie also features Betty Field, Charles Coburn, and Claude Rains. The musical score was composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and the cinematographer was James Wong Howe.Source: Korngold, Erich Wolfgang.
